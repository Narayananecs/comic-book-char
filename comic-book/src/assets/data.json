Humans weren't enough for him, he wanted to control all the Masters of the Night. He met Tenardier, an architect and alchemist member of the cult of the Great Old Ones, who offered him greater power in exchange of immortality as one of his un-deads. Tenardier and his followers were about the fulfill a ritual that was supposed to turn Verdier in a superior being, but <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/araxe-de-kerkadio/4005-82569/\">Araxe De Kerkadio</a> intervened to stop it and threw Verdier into the sacrificial pit. That caused a great explosion to occur, sign of the rage of the ancient gods. She thought that was the end, but it was still alive. Tenardier brought him to one of his manors, where Verdier recovered his strength, but, the Great Old Ones turned him into a mindless and horrible monster. With time, Verdier expanded himself in the entire mansion, becoming one with it, and started to consume the people who set up home there, turning them into his slaves.</p>",

John Ross, a travelling magician of the Victorian London, inherited those gifts and his powers. Initially, he didn't comprehend what happened and was unable to control his powers, wandering randomly through parallel worlds of different ages or structure, as well as different flows of time. Eventually he realized everything and mastered his powers, sending his mind to another self each time he was on the verge of death. He lived uncountably lives, in many worlds and eras, so much that he even lost the count. During one of these trips he found the Plateau of Leng, the followers of the Kuen - Yuin and the cult of the Great Old Ones.

Hank McCoy’s father was exposed to radiation during a meltdown when working at the nuclear power plant. Because of this, it seems to be the reason why Hank was born with unusually large feet and hands and a high I.Q. He had a huge curiosity since childhood, disassembling anything he could so he could understand the function of everything and to create a hypothesis. Because of his irregular proportions, his schoolmates teased him and gave him the nickname of <a href=\"/magilla-gorilla/4005-55610/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55610\">\"Magilla Gorilla</a>\" and \"Beast\". Hank only started to come out of his shell when he started tutoring <a href=\"/jennifer-nyles/4005-59119/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59119\">Jennifer Nyles</a>. She started to see the real Hank McCoy, and on the night of the prom she turned up at his place with a rented tuxedo and told him she was taking him to the prom. When some people started to tease them, Jennifer knocked out the leader of the taunters with one punch.</p><p>After that Hank and Jennifer were inseparable, and in love with each other, but still not going out. During Hank's teen years, his mutant abilities started to show themselves and allowed him to excel in sports and academics in school. Hank ended up joining the football team after the coach asked him to kick a football and he kicked the skin off it. However, this caused jealousy amongst his classmates.</p><p>Sadly, Hank and Jennifer went their separate ways after awhile; she traveled to <a href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\">London</a> to study genetics while Hank stayed in the United States. One day, three masked men robbed the stadium and tried to escape across it. Luckily, Hank was nearby and he managed to knock out all three men. This made it to the news. The villain known only as the <a href=\"/el-conquistador/4005-38214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38214\">Conquistador</a> decided that he could use Hank as a weapon after seeing this report. The Conquistador successfully managed to kidnap Hank and his parents, and told him that he would release them if he stole an experimental nuclear device for him.</p><p>When Hank returned, the Conquistador revealed that he would actually keep Hank's parents prisoners indefinitely, until Hank was of no more use to him. Hank tried to escape and was almost killed if it wasn't for <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Charles Xavier</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> and <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> saving Hank, before offering a spot for him in Xavier's school (<a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>). The school was a haven for mutants and also the headquarters of the mutant team, the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. Hank took advantage of the offer, mainly in order to further his academic intelligence and ended up completing his doctorate in biophysics at Xavier's. There, he received the codename \"Beast.\"</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/201888-3704-beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201888\" data-ratio=\"1.2276785714286\" data-width=\"224\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 224px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/201888-3704-beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-201888\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/201888-3704-beast.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/201888-3704-beast.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" data-width=\"224\"></a></figure><p>Beast was created by the team of <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for the first X-Men book and thus first appeared in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-x-men-1-x-men/4000-6694/\">The (Uncanny) X-Men issue 1</a>(1963).</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111133169/3367208-beast1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3367208\" data-ratio=\"1.3516129032258\" data-width=\"620\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111133169/3367208-beast1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3367208\"><img alt=\"Hank before his current mutation in \"All-New X-Men\".\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" data-width=\"473\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111133169/3367208-beast1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11113/111133169/3367208-beast1.jpg 620w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11113/111133169/3367208-beast1.jpg 473w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hank before his current mutation in \"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hank before his current mutation in \"All-New X-Men\".</figcaption></figure><p>Beast originally started out as a man with larger appendages and a keen intellect.

But one of Hank's opponents was none other than <a href=\"/unus/4005-3438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3438\">Unus the Untouchable</a>, who was also a mutant. Hank realized that his place was still with the X-Men, and built a device to increase Unus' powers to the point where he couldn't control them.

Calvin was a mutant who could copy the powers of other mutants, and he was at first a villain, but later joined the X-Men for a short while.</p><p>Over time, Xavier granted the X-Men new costumes as a reward for proving themselves time after time. Hank received a new blue-and-red costume which was similar to his training costume. Not much later after that, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a> appeared, who wanted to test his skill against Beast. Kraven poisoned the X-Men's house guest, <a href=\"/avia/4005-13319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13319\">Avia</a>, and would only give the antidote if he was allowed to fight Beast without interruption. Kraven wasn't the type to play fairly, and he had traps all around the house to try and stop Beast. Hank couldn't dodge them all and was hit by some drugged darts. The darts had been meant to slow down the blood flow to Beast's brain, thus slowing his reflexes, but had a side-effect. With Hank's higher-brain functions inhibited, it made him revert to a frenzied rage, and would have killed Kraven if the X-Men hadn't stopped him. After this fight, Beast held back in action in case another incident like this occurred.</p><h3>The Brand Corporation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-689994\" data-ratio=\"1.0525\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-689994\"><img alt=\"Hirsute Hank\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hirsute Hank\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/29818/689994-beast14.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hirsute Hank</figcaption></figure><p>Hank went on to work as a genetic researcher at a corporation called \" <a href=\"/brand-corporation/4060-32019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32019\">Brand Corporation</a>.\" At Brand Corporation Hank met his assistant, <a href=\"/linda-donaldson/4005-37198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37198\">Linda Donaldson</a>, and his bitter superior, <a href=\"/carl-maddicks/4005-30821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30821\">Carl Maddicks</a>. Hank successfully managed to create the hormonal extract that creates mutations in organic beings, but when he rushed to tell Carl Maddicks about it he overheard him discussing a plan to steal some government records. Hank took his extract to disguise himself and increase his power. Unfortunately, Hank had the extract in him for too long, therefore leaving him permanently transformed. This enhanced his agility, stamina and strength. Other side effects were the growth of fangs, pointed ears, claws, enhanced senses, a healing factor and blue (originally gray) fur that covered his entire body. Hank then completed his doctorate in genetics and is one of the world's experts on mutations and human biology. As a result of the failure, Linda Donaldson shot Carl Maddicks, since she was actually a spy for the <a href=\"/secret-empire/4060-15136/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15136\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-113150\" data-ratio=\"0.84269662921348\" data-width=\"356\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 356px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-113150\"><img alt=\"Gray Beast\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg 356w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gray Beast\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg 356w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/113150-58885-beast.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gray Beast</figcaption></figure><p>Hank knew that he couldn't walk around looking like a gorilla, so he spent all night reading up on latex masks and disguises before making gloves and a rubber face mask that he could wear over his own. Hank's posture was also like that of a gorilla, and he had to use a special harness to help him walk and stand like an ordinary man. When <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> visited Brand, a crisis required him and Hank to go to the rescue as superheroes. <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> mistook Beast for a villain, and fought with him. The X-Men's old foe <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Mastermind</a> watched from a distance and created the illusion in Hank's mind of him having killed Iron Man. Hank was then easily tricked into joining the <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, but he managed to overcome the illusion and leave.</p><p>Since Beast had been seen around Brand Corporation a lot, the <a href=\"/the-pentagon/4020-55834/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\">Pentagon</a> sent <a href=\"/buzz-baxter/4005-12726/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12726\">Buzz Baxter</a> and his wife <a href=\"/patsy-walker/4005-3316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3316\">Patsy Walker</a> to investigate. Ironically, Beast turned up at Patsy's house after a near defeat from <a href=\"/quasimodo/4005-7230/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7230\">Quasimodo</a>. Patsy helped heal Hank, and for some reason his fur turned from gray to bluish-black. Patsy also learned Beast's real identity, since he had been talking in his dreams. She agreed not to reveal his secret, but didn't tell Hank what she wanted in return. Shortly afterwards, Hank was captured by Linda Donaldson, and delivered to the Secret Empire.

Hank decided to try being a superhero with another group after he saw an ad for new members on TV. Beast and <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a> were accepted as probationary members, mere minutes before the <a href=\"/stranger/4005-13332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13332\">Stranger</a> attacked the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> (actually <a href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\">Toad</a> in disguise). \"The Stranger\" filled a stadium with floating mines, which the other Avengers were defeated by, but Beast's agility let him get through the mines whilst Moondragon's mental powers stopped their foe. Whilst a member of the Avengers, Beast became good friends with <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>.</p><p>With Beast a member of the Avengers, it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"/patsy-walker/4005-3316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3316\">Patsy Walker</a> returned. It turned out that the deal she had made with Beast in return for not revealing his identity was that she was to become a superhero, since she was bored of being a housewife. Beast had already revealed his alternate identity to the rest of the Avengers, though, so she had nothing to hold over him. Even so, Beast let Patsy accompany them on one mission to repay her for not revealing his identity. Whilst raiding <a href=\"/roxxon/4060-56010/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon</a> Oil, the Avengers came across the old gear of the Cat (who didn't need it now that she was <a href=\"/tigra/4005-21188/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21188\">Tigra</a>). Patsy used the equipment to become <a href=\"/patsy-walker/4005-3316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3316\">Hellcat</a>, which meant she got her wish to become a superhero after all. Moondragon and Hellcat both left the Avengers when they restarted their roster, but Beast was more than happy to stay on. One of the many bonuses of being an Avenger was that Beast was no longer hated or feared as a mutant.</p><p>Sometimes Beast would leave to help with the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> when they were in need of help and to make space for new recruits. One time that he temporarily left was when he hadn't heard from the X-Men in a while, and went to the mansion to check up on them. For some reason, the mansion was abandoned. Beast went looking for the X-Men with <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> and found them performing as freaks in a carnival. It turned out that the carnival was run by <a href=\"/mesmero/4005-5065/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5065\">Mesmero</a>, but shortly after the X-Men were broken free from his hypnosis, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> captured the X-Men and took them to his secret base in</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081485\" data-ratio=\"0.62946428571429\" data-width=\"896\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 896px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081485\"><img alt=\"No one gets along with Gyrich.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 896w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No one gets along with Gyrich.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 896w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No one gets along with Gyrich.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/antarctica/4020-55940/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a>, which was hidden beneath an active volcano.

One problem that they Avengers had was that <a href=\"/henry-gyrich/4005-9711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9711\">Henry Peter Gyrich</a> of the National Security Agency limited the members of the Avengers allowed. Whilst Beast was on this team, <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a> unfortunately was not, and so Beast's best friend on the Avengers had to leave. Shortly after Hank found out that the X-Men were still alive after the events in <a href=\"/antarctica/4020-55940/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a>, <a href=\"/henry-gyrich/4005-9711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9711\">Henry Gyrich</a> continued to plague the Avengers, this time trying to get rid of their government clearance.</p><p>The Avengers had a trial in court, and it was not going well, but when reports of a rampaging monster were heard, Beast suggested that Gyrich should fight the monster himself. Gyrich had to admit that the heroes were needed, and so the Avengers got back their security clearances. Shortly afterwards, Falcon quit the team, and Wonder Man was called back to replace him. One night, when Hank was on duty by himself, he received a message that the X-Men were on a rampage in the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>. Torn between friends and responsibility, Hank decided to aid the X-Men. Beast witnessed Jean Grey's transformation to <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/4005-9731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9731\">Dark Phoenix</a>, a fight between the X-Men and the Shi'ar <a href=\"/imperial-guard/4060-6097/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6097\">Imperial Guard</a> on <a href=\"/the-moon/4020-42072/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42072\">the Moon</a>, Jean's suicide, and her funeral before he returned to the Avengers.</p><p>Beast met his old girlfriend <a href=\"/vera-cantor/4005-15374/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15374\">Vera Cantor</a> in a bar by complete chance, and the two talked all night. Beast took her back to Avenger's mansion, but upon drinking some tea <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a> provided, Vera fell into a coma. \" <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Jarvis</a>\" was actually a <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a> who had poisoned Vera so that she could be used as blackmail. He told the Avengers that he would only provide Vera with a cure to her coma if the Avengers got a rare artifact called the Resurrection Stone for him. The team used the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four's</a> time travel device to acquire the item in the past for the Skrull, but Hank destroyed it before they handed it to him, since it was too powerful to trust the Skrull with. The best the Avengers could do for Vera was to give her to <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> in the hope that he could find a cure for her coma.</p><p>Despite that they had been glad that Henry Gyrich was not longer bugging them, the Avengers realized there were some things he had done that made sense. For example, the current team had 10 members, and was too unorganized. After a talk with Wonder Man, Beast began to realize if he really did just want to be a joking superhero.

Beast opened up to Vera his insecurities about being a superhero, and she tried to help Beast by pushing him into a relationship. Because Beast was silent, Vera mistook this for agreement, when it was actually insecurity.</p><p>Beast eventually realized that super heroics are what he's best at, but still didn't like the Defenders' status as a non-team. Beast reorganized the Defenders, adding his old teammates Iceman and Angel to it, as well as <a href=\"/gargoyle/4005-7114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7114\">Gargoyle</a>, <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Valkyrie</a> and <a href=\"/moondragon/4005-7214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7214\">Moondragon</a>.

They sent it to Reed Richards to examine, and when he cut it open Jean Grey came out. Shocked at the state of mutant affairs in the world, Jean wanted to do something about it, but not as an X-Man, since the X-Men were being led by <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>. Jean, Beast, <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> and Cyclops all rejoined and they formed the group called <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a>. On their second mission, Hank was kidnapped by <a href=\"/carl-maddicks/4005-30821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30821\">Carl Maddicks</a>, who was apparently alive, for experimentation to find a \"cure\" for his son <a href=\"/artie/4005-10574/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10574\">Artie's</a> mutation. This turned Beast back into a human form. Hank also met with Vera Cantor more, who had a change of appearance. She now wore her hair half shaved and wore flashier clothing. After Vera was interviewed by <a href=\"/trish-tilby/4005-3178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3178\">Trish Tilby</a>, a reporter hot on X-Factor's trail, Vera and Hank stopped seeing each other, as their lives had gone in different directions.</p><p>During a fight with <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse's</a> Horsemen, Beast was touched by <a href=\"/pestilence/4005-24133/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24133\">Pestilence</a>, whose virus causes a deadly sickness. Instead of Hank becoming sick, it reacted with Hank's recent change so that every time he used his superhuman strength, Beast's intelligence would drop. Hank's intelligence dropped for weeks and he opened up to Trish Tilby, not realizing that she would use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank, Trish did tell the world that one of X-Factor's members was losing his intelligence, but didn't say which. When Iceman was almost kissed by <a href=\"/infectia/4005-15089/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15089\">Infectia</a>, who could mutate people into monsters by touch, Beast intercepted the kiss. This made him change between his furry form and human form, until he finally stayed in his furred form, with his usual intelligence and strength. The next time Hank met Trish, she was having trouble accepting Hank's new furry form. Hank and Trish realized they had missed each other after a mission in space, and started dating.</p><p>Trish's duties as a news reporter caused some trouble with their relationship, since she had to make mutants look bad. During one of Trish's assignments in <a href=\"/india/4020-55919/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55919\">India</a>, Hank came over to say goodbye to her, only to see her kissing her ex-husband, <a href=\"/paul/4005-65539/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65539\">Paul</a>. Seeing this, Hank left without saying goodbye to Trish. One day, Hank was invited to attend the International Symposium on Mutant Research in <a href=\"/belgium/4020-55916/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55916\">Belgium</a>. Hank wanted to take this very seriously, as his old girlfriend <a href=\"/jennifer-nyles/4005-59119/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59119\">Jennifer Nyles</a> would be attending the conference. Just then, a cyborg tried to kill the mail-woman who was delivering the letter to him that stated he would be invited. Whilst at the conference, Hank uncovered a plot involving cyborgs and genetic programming. The leader of this conspiracy, <a href=\"/commander-courage/4005-61508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61508\">Commander Courage</a>, was going to infect world leaders with <a href=\"/techno-organic/4015-43631/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43631\">techno-organic</a> implants and take over the world.</p><h3>Back to the X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261701\" data-ratio=\"0.8375\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261701\"><img alt=\"Even when preparing to face a serious threat, Hank always keeps up team morale.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg 800w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Even when preparing to face a serious threat, Hank always keeps up team morale.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg 800w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1261701-hankmccoy0115l.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even when preparing to face a serious threat, Hank always keeps up team morale.</figcaption></figure><p>Jennifer Nyles was unknowingly working on this, since when <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> had mind-wiped her all those years ago, she knew something precious in her mind had gone, and devoted her life to getting it back.

It was later discovered that <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a> had taken over the minds of almost everyone on <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a>. Since that included most of the X-Men, Professor X enlisted the help of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> and X-Factor to stop <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a>. After the defeat of Shadow King, X-Factor merged with the X-Men and the team was split into two squads: a Gold Strike team and a Blue Strike team.

It wasn't until their deadly villain Apocalypse offered his assistance that Professor X could be cured. Before he died, Stryfe got his revenge on the X-Men by releasing the <a href=\"/legacy-virus/4015-42281/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42281\">Legacy Virus</a> into the atmosphere. The Legacy Virus is a virus that is deadly to mutants, attacking their x-factor gene and killing them.

Professor Xavier and Moira MacTaggert only added to these doubts when they excluded him from their research on the Legacy Virus. Hank had a look at their research and admitted that it was far beyond him.</p><p>Despite this, Beast still tried to cure the Virus, going to extremes. Beast allowed <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister</a> access to a mutant named <a href=\"/threnody/4005-15116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15116\">Threnody</a>, who could sense the effects of the Legacy Virus, since Sinister had more resources and less morals, which gave him more of a chance to cure it.

After a brief encounter with Ord, Beast went to visit his old friend, <a href=\"/dr-kavita-rao/4005-4446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4446\">Dr. Kavita Rao</a> to get a sample of the \"cure\". He takes it back to the Institute, and begins to study it. Wolverine then comes to his lab, telling Beast that Emma told him that his mind was basically screaming it out that he wanted to take the cure. Wolverine tells him to flush it but Beast refuses to do so, and the two fight it out, until Emma stops them telepathically and threatens to make them tango. When he finds out that Rao had been testing the cure on corpses of other mutants, he helps stop her and Ord, and he and the X-Men destroy the base.</p><p>After a confrontation with <a href=\"/danger/4005-40862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger</a>, <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\">Cassandra Nova</a> psionically attacks the team. She strips Beast of all his morality, intellect and basically his mind, leaving him as basically, a feral beast. He attacked Wolverine and bit off some flesh on his leg (obviously it grew back). Luckily, the student <a href=\"/blindfold/4005-40597/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40597\">Blindfold</a> used a \"sensory stimulant\", something the Professor and Beast invented, just in case of a situation like this. The stimulant was in a form of a ball of string. Beast then used a special magnet he'd created to stop Danger and Ord. The X-Men, Ord and Danger are teleported away to <a href=\"/sword/4060-41666/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41666\">SWORD</a>, and travel to the Breakworld. Beast is one of the X-Men taken with them. Later, he and <a href=\"/abigail-brand/4005-4441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4441\">Abigail Brand</a> are separated from the main squad, and almost freeze to death but Agent Brand manages to save them by generating heat to keep them warm (no one knows how she did this yet).</p><p>She later dives in front of a laser to save him, believing that he is the one with the best chance to save Earth. He gets to the missile along with some of the others. Danger finds a signature on the missile of <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Illyana Rasputin</a> and as they talk, the missile, with Kitty inside, is fired. Beast then realizes that it's not a missile, but a bullet. As Beast team doubles back to their ship he finds Agent Brand who survived the laser blast and they pick up their antagonistic banter with each other. When Beast accuses Brand of still keeping things from him and after he persisted she admits that she is really attracted to him. Once back on Earth Brand takes a walk with Henry and waits for his response on the job with SWORD that she has offered him, as she believes him to be qualified both professionally and personally and states as much. Beast is later shown with Brand and several X-students in a lab both him and Brand looking pleased.</p><h3><a href=\"/endangered-species/4045-43950/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43950\">Endangered Species</a></h3><p>Since the events of <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a> Beast has tirelessly tried to reverse their effects and avoid mutant extinction. Dr. McCoy sought the help of some of the Marvel U's most brilliant scientist and heroes in order to find a solution. Making little progress, Beast then extended his plea for help to some of the most intelligent and ruthless villains such as Mr. Sinister, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, and the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a>. After receiving little assistance from most of the villains, Beast made his way to the now defunct mutant concentration camp, <a href=\"/neverland/4020-55994/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55994\">Neverland</a>. While searching Neverland for anything that could aid his research, he was confronted by Dark Beast who offered his help. Beast apprehensively agreed, and the two have formed a strained partnership. After the two research for a while, they begin to fight about each others ways. After research with others, Beast went to see the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a>, who remembers nothing about her former life.

Beast spent his time in the subbasement destroying all the student and teacher files fearing what would happen if they fell into the wrong hands. He then emailed the information for <a href=\"/stryfe/4005-7616/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7616\">Stryfe's</a> Legacy Virus to five scientist he trusted thinking that no matter what happens to him, the anti-virus would always be safe. Beast then took <a href=\"/no-girl/4005-41121/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41121\">Martha Johansson</a> and left the institute putting a No Admittance sign on the gates.</p><p>After <a href=\"/messiah-complex/4045-48995/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48995\">Messiah CompleX</a>, Beast relocated to <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a> with the rest of the X-Men.

With this team he traveled back in time (1906) in order to find Nemesis' parents and discover the origins of modern mutation, hoping to find a way to save the mutantkind. While in the past, the X-Club encounter an earlier version of the Sentinel made by the Hellfire of the 1906 and had also accidentally caused the San Francisco earthquake. Unfortunately, when the X-Club returned to the past, the DNA evidence had been buried beneath the <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/4005-22836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22836\">Dreaming Celestial</a> in the park.</p><p>Beast started to have doubts on whether or not to stay with the X-Men.

Sensing that he will not survive this next transformation, he endeavors to study and cure himself on his own. Beast reinforces here that he is the leading expert on genetic mutation and mutant physiology. Beast converses with Iceman and Storm about the direction that Cyclops is headed post-AvX, and agrees with Bobby that Scott from the past would not have agreed with his future actions. Beast then transports himself back in time, arriving during a moment when his past-self had just concluded arguing with young Cyclops about staying with the X-Men. Past-Beast had just been attacked by anti-mutant humans, and had become disillusioned with Xavier's cause. Future-Beast then confronts Cyclops and asks him to accompany him back to the future to reason with his future-self. During this time, Beast transforms into a new form similar to his old ape-like incarnation.</p><p>Around this period, Beast is inducted into the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a>, taking the place of the deceased Professor X.

After he meets with the X-Men to tell them this, he suggests that mutants could leave the planet in order to avoid the Cloud. However, Storm, Emma Frost and Magneto disagree, believing that it would be better to go to war with the Inhumans and destroy the Cloud themselves. Storm incapacitates Hank, and a massive conflict between the X-Men and Inhumans later unfolds.

In his human form, Beast could lift 1 ton. His simian form could lift 10 tons. Even though he mutated to his feline form, he can still only lift about 10 tons. He has strong fingers and toes, using his razor sharp claws on his hands and his feet to scale walls. He has thick blue fur all over his body. Hank has great manual and pedal dexterity and can perform several complicated tasks using both his hands and feet such as tying knots with his feet. He has long appendages that allow to him to walk on all fours. Beast has superhuman durability, though he is very far from invulnerable. He can survive a fall from 3 stories if he lands on his feet and being struck by superhuman strong foes that would kill an average human. Beast can run for short sprints at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. He has enhanced senses such as night-vision and a sense of smell that can track a human and also has a slight healing factor. This healing factor allows him to recover from slight sicknesses like colds quickly. He also heals broken bones in a couple days, where it takes regular people weeks, even months. Furthermore, in contrast to his superhuman powers, he is extremely intelligent. He is one of the smartest people in the Marvel Universe. He is a world authority in biochemistry and genetics as well as being the X-Men's medical doctor (though he never received an M.D.) which shows his vast intellect.</p><p>Later on, when he has taken on a secondary mutation, his smelling, strength, sight and reflexes are enhanced even further. The secondary mutation gave him the a feline appearance. The downside to this mutation is that Hank has lost his super human dexterity. He has stated that he used to play the guitar but now plays the drums as a result of the lost dexterity. Beast is a capable hand to hand combatant. He has been trained by <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor Xavier</a>, in a fighting style that makes good use of his agility, strength and speed.

He has a severe inferiority complex because of his appearance. While on a mission to save the presidents daughter, Beast is nearly dies and the procedure to save him turns his hair blue. When the Ultimate X-Men were forcibly drafted into <a href=\"/weapon-x/4060-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X</a>, he was mutated into a more powerful blue furred form. He gained enhanced senses and strength. He had an on-and-off relationship with <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, which he broke off because he could not believe she loved him without the Professor mind-controlling her to.

He later left the X-Men, because he didn't believe that Storm could truly love him and joined a government funded group. He seemingly died after a Sentinel attack.</p><p>Later, it was revealed that Beast was still alive (after being revived at a hospital) and working with SHIELD for a Legacy Virus cure. He has reversed his physique back to a human-like state, but he retained his heightened abilities. He seems to have died during the flood of Ultimatum. Beast in Earth 1610 's abilities are very similar to Earth 616. He possesses superhuman strength, agility, dexterity, flexibility, and stamina. The Weapon X program mutated him in to a form that was covered in thick blue fur and had claws and fangs.</p><h3>Earth-15104 (Here Comes Tomorrow)</h3><p>In the \"Here Comes Tomorrow\" reality, Beast was possessed by <a href=\"/sublime/4005-11330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11330\">Sublime</a>, and was the world's greatest villain.</p><h3>Earth-TRN240 (Possibly Earth-616's past)</h3><p>This is the version of Beast that was sent from the past to the present by the adult Beast, along with the original five X-Men. Beast seems to handle the surprise that he will mutate to something \"blue and furry\" rather well. When the older version of himself seems to be dying due to a third mutation, the younger Beast saves him. Beast is one of the X-Men who voted to stay in the future and try to fix it. After reading the mind of the older beast, Jean Grey realizes that he was in love with her when he was younger. With this knowledge, she confronts Beast and asks him about it. At first Beast seems embarrassed and shocked that she read his mind, but then she confesses that she likes him as well. They start to begin a relationship, but after the events of Battle of the Atom, Beast ends it, due to Jean running off with Scott after he refused to leave with her. However, they get back together later on only for them to break up again during the gap between Secret Wars and All-New, All Different Marvel.</p><h3>Earth-1298 (Mutant X)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430413\" data-ratio=\"1.5226586102719\" data-width=\"331\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 331px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2430413\"><img alt=\"Mutant X #24\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg 331w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mutant X #24\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg 331w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2430413-mx24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mutant X #24</figcaption></figure><p>Henry McCoy was one of the original <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>.

In his position as genetic researcher, McCoy attempted to isolate the cellular catalyst that causes mutations--using himself as a guinea pig. The results were disastrous. Instead of reversing the mutation, as was his intent, McCoy caused himself to undergo a complete physical metamorphosis. Now, McCoy was a literal beast--a green-skinned, amphibious monster.

Beast is accredited with making the New Mutant's uniforms. After, Beast's cure backfires he becomes very self-conscious about his appearance. However, after some motivation from Mystique, Beast accepts who he has become, and agrees to fly the New Mutants in his stealth jet. Also, Havok, complimented Beast's new appearance. Havok declared that McCoy looked \"like a beast.\" In the last battle, where the New Mutants fight Sebastian Shaw and company, Beast plays a vital role. Beast, along with Havok are sent by Xavier to ward off Sebastian Shaw's right hand man, Azazel. He uses his specific Mutant ability, teleportation, to drop Havok on an enemy base. This action left Beast to handle Azazel alone. After much back and forth, Beast gets the upper hand and knocks out Azazel. In the end, Beast is one of the Mutants, that remains loyal to Charles Xavier, despite his weakened condition. He is played by Nicholas Hoult.</p><h4>X-Men: Days of Future Past</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3740020-hank.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3740020\" data-ratio=\"1.45703125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3740020-hank.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3740020\"><img alt=\"Beast and Storm\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-width=\"439\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3740020-hank.png 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg 658w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg 439w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Beast and Storm\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3740020-hank.png 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg 658w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3740020-hank.jpg 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-width=\"439\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Beast and Storm</figcaption></figure><p>Beast returns as a main character in<a href=\"/x-men-days-of-future-past/4025-1549/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1549\"><em> X-Men: Days of Future Past</em></a>, with Nicholas Hoult reprising his role.

The tattoos in his skin were the markings of a warrior amongst the Nightbrother clan. He has two brothers named Savage and Feral, one of which he would later meet in his adulthood.</p><p>Maul from his early years has trained in the ways of the dark side. He does not have any memories of his home world of Iridonia or of his birth family. He is incapable of normal emotion, only experiencing blood lust and rage.</p><p>During his training, any show of fear was severely punished by <a href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\">Sidious</a>. Also, if he even hinted at the thought of mercy he would be treated with cruelty. By the time Maul reached adolescence, his master forged him into a weapon of pure hatred. Marked by <a href=\"/the-sith/4060-44460/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44460\">Sith</a> tattoos that cover his entire body, Maul is the ultimate tool of the dark side. Despite this rather traumatic childhood, Maul adores his Master, and has never once contemplated killing him.</p><p>Sidious abandoned Maul on an isolated Outer Rim world, forcing him to survive alone while being hunted by hordes of assassin droids. After a month's time, his master returned and challenged him to a duel, one which the already severely weakened Maul quickly loses. Sidious then tells Maul that he has failed and is soon to be replaced. Overwhelmed by hatred, Maul nearly defeats his master. When Maul's emotions are finally spent, he prepares to die, yet his master laughs instead. By wanting to kill his own master, Maul has, in fact, passed the final test. His master proclaims him Darth Maul, Dark Lord of the Sith, and gives him a new home on <a href=\"/coruscant/4020-48936/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-48936\">Coruscant</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Black Sun</h3><p>After becoming a Sith Lord, Maul completed numerous covert missions and assassinations for his Master, Darth Sidious. One of the most infamous of these was when Maul single-handedly took on the galaxy-spanning crime syndicate known as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/black-sun/4060-52833/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52833\">The Black Sun</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3805866\" data-ratio=\"1.5320987654321\" data-width=\"810\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 810px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3805866\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.png 810w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.jpg 626w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114474/3805866-wiki%20pic.jpg 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></a></figure><p>Piloting his Sith Infiltrator ship, Maul began travelling from system to system, tearing the Black Sun apart from the inside, killing numerous second-in-command Black Sun Vigos and leaving nothing but destruction in his wake. He easily infiltrated their bases, slaughtered their security forces (which included Force users) and assassinated their leaders.</p><p>After throwing the organization into complete disarray, he targeted their main stronghold, which housed the Black Sun's leader <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alexi_Garyn\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Alexi Garyn</a>. Maul slaughtered the entire Black Sun security Force. He then went on to kill seven of the galaxy's most deadly mercenaries in less time than it takes to say it. A telepath among the Black Sun's ranks attempted to probe Maul's thoughts in an attempt to find out who he was and why he was attacking the Black Sun, but due to the magnitude of darkness lingering in Maul's mind, the telepath fell into a coma almost immediately.</p><p>Alexi Garyn's last line of defence was a Dathomirian Nightsister named Mighella. Despite her skill in the Dark Side she proved to be no match for the Sith Lord, and was defeated even after attempting to destroy Maul with Force Lightning.</p><p>Maul caught up with Garyn soon after, and after a brief conversation followed by an attempt at resistance on Garyn's part, Maul choked him to death with his bare hands. He returned to Sidious, his mission complete.</p><h3>Lockdown</h3><p>Maul was next assigned a mission by his Master to hunt down an infamous black market weapons dealer named <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Iram_Radique\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Iram Radique</a>, who was believed to be operating inside the prison colony <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Cog_Hive_Seven\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Cog Hive Seven</a>. Maul successfully infiltrated the prison under the fake persona of a mercenary called Jagganath.</p><p>Maul soon discovered that Cog Hive Seven was not just a prison. It also hosted gladiatorial bouts between inmates as well as various fierce and famous predatory creatures from around the galaxy. He was subsequently thrown into such match ups where despite vastly unfavourable circumstances, he was able to defeat all of his opponents, inmates and creatures alike.</p><p>These death matches were a part of an underground gambling operation, which the prison's Warden <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sadiki_Blirr\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Sadiki Blirr</a> made millions of credits of profit from due to an algorithm created by her brother, that would predict the outcome of every match with a 100% success rate, allowing her to set odds on contestants that would yield the most profit.</p><p>While inside Cog Hive Seven, Maul soon discovered that his real objective was to buy a nuclear weapon from Radique, who had secretly been doing his black weapon weapons manufacturing in Cog Hive Seven itself under the nose of Blirr. He would then sell this weapon to the Bando Gora, which, due to the fact Radique hates the Banda Gora, made it all the more difficult to do so.</p><p>Meanwhile, during Maul's investiagations, Blirr found out that a Hutt had assigned a security force which had infiltrated her guards to protect Radique. After losing her brother, the prisoners escaping and a mass riot ensuing throughout the prison, she detonates the prison's self-destruct sequence.</p><p>As this is happening the Banda Gora arrive, with their leader <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/komari-vosa/4005-53601/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53601\">Komari Vosa</a>. Radique is killed by an inmate assisting Maul, and Maul has a brief fight with Vosa in which he gets the upper hand. Soon realizing that their goal is a common one, they team up to defeat the <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Syrox\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Syrox</a>, a massive worm that had killed Blirr as well as many inmates and guards. They are then able to escape from the soon-exploding prison ship, Maul's mission complete to a suitable enough standard for his Master all circumstances considered.</p><h3>The Phantom Menace</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3077020\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3077020\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132327/3077020-maul-at-his-prime.png 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After landing on Naboo he came in contact with two <a href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\">Jedi</a> and the Queen of Naboo. Maul went straight at the two Jedi, ignoring the queen and allowing her to escape. In a vicious duel Maul fended off both of his Jedi opponents with the help of his double-bladed lightsaber. After separating the Jedi Master from his Padawan, Maul finally succeeded in slaying <a href=\"/qui-gon-jinn/4005-5411/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5411\">Jinn</a>. He then challenged <a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Kenobi</a>. The young Padawan, enraged at his master's death, struck out at Maul with a furious assault. Maul eventually Force-pushed Kenobi into a pit. He then taunted the Padawan, who dangled helplessly by a ledge, watching his lightsaber fall down into the abyss. However, Kenobi instantly calmed down and connected with the <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">Force</a>. He makes a spectacular leap out of the shaft and Force-guides Jinn's lightsaber into his own hands. Wasting no time in striking as he landed from his jump, Kenobi cuts the astounded Maul in two before he can react. Maul barely has time to grimace as his body tumbles down the shaft in two pieces.</p><h3>Return and Revenge</h3><p>Maul survived his near death by using Sidious' training and managed to end up on the junk planet of Lotho Minor in the Outer Rim. With the power of the Force, he turned himself into a cyborg with an arachnid-like lower half, and managed to survive for over a decade. During the following years Maul's mind sank into a insanity until he was found by his brother, Savage Opress. Brought back to Dathomir, Savage brings to Mother Talzin, who purges of his mind of madness and is given a new pair of robotic legs crafted by Talzin's magic. With his mind restored, Maul learns from his brother that the Clone Wars have started without him. Then, with the help of Opress, proceeds to extract revenge on Obi-Wan by luring him to a trap. Due to an unexpected appearance by Asajj Ventress however, Kenobi manages to escape. But realizing that the Jedi are now aware of his return, Maul and his brother decide remain in hiding all while secretly plotting their revenge.</p><h3>Death Sentence</h3><p>Darth Maul and his brother <a href=\"/savage-opress/4005-75666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75666\">Savage Opress</a> hide out on the planet Paklan when they are attacked by bounty hunters. They brutally take down their assailants and force a name from their leader, Ja'Boag. Ja'Boag runs a mining operation on the plant Moorjhone. The brothers arrive on the planet and scope out Ja'Boag's security detail. Maul commands one of the soldiers to walk back to his unit with a thermal detonator. Maul and Opress tear through the soldiers and toss Ja'Boag into the mine. He is saved by three Jedi who have come to stop Darth Maul. Salmara attempts to negotiate with Maul but fails as Judd steps in to battle the brothers. A barrel containing carbonite is thrown at Opress who unknowingly slices it in half, encasing himself with its contents. Enraged over his brothers demise, Maul breaks Judd's arm with his foot claw and is about to finish him when the Padwan Dray stabs him in the side. Maul slices off Dray's hands and escapes into the desert. He wanders until he passes out but is found and saved by the planets native inhabitants. They believe Darth Maul will be their saviour.</p><h3>Rise and Fall</h3><p>Darth Maul and Savage later decide to form their own army to challenge the Republic and the Separatists by aligning with several pirate crews and later the Mandalorian Death Watch. With the aid of Pre Vizla, Maul and Savage succeed in conquering Mandalore and overthrowing the Duchess Satine. However, they were betrayed by Vizla and the Death Watch who decided to capture the brothers and lock them up. Maul would later break free and defeat Pre Vizla in combat becoming both the new leader of the Death Watch criminal empire. He ruled from the shadows, with Prime Minister Almec as his puppet. He would also enact his revenge on Obi-Wan Kenobi by murdering Satine right in front of Kenobi to make him suffer. Eventually his actions would catch the attention of his former master, Darth Sidious.</p><p>As a small militia of the Death Watch (which included Kenobi and Satine's sister, Bo Katan) were starting to overthrow Maul's rule, Darth Sidious arrived amongst the skirmish to confront his former apprentice. Maul immediately requested to return to his side, but Sidious refused, seeing that Maul had his brother have become a rival and the potential threat to his plans. Maul and Savage battles Sidious with all their skill but they prove to be no match as the Sith Lord kills Savage and subdues Maul. Defeated, Maul begs for mercy which Sidious accepts, believing that he may be of use to him...</p><p> </p><h3>Son of Dathomir</h3><p>After his defeat at Darth Sidious' hands, Maul was captured and taken to a secret prison on the planet Stygeon. There, he was repeatedly questioned and tortured by his former Master and later <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Count Dooku</a> as to give up the names of his Shadow Collective companions' and the location of their secret bases. As he was being questioned by the Count, two of Maul's <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mandalorian-death-watch/4060-52835/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52835\">Death Watch</a> commando allies invaded the prison and set up explosives on a lower level to try and draw attention away from Maul's cell and floor level. Despite Dooku seeing through the scheme, the commandos were able to rescue Maul, blow a hole in the side of the prison, and lead him to their ship, escaping the prison and the planet, though this was actually part of Sidious' scheme all along. After leaving the planet, Maul is taken to a Shadow Collective base on the swamp moon Zanbar. There he is greeted by Prime Minister Almec, who gives Maul his Darksaber and informs him that the Pykes and Black Sun are still loyal to the Sith Lord. Immediately after, Maul is informed that Separatist ships had followed his ship to the moon, and have started sending in their drop ships. Leading the defense of his base, Maul jumps into the battle only to be confronted by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/general-grievous/4005-44582/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44582\">General Grievous</a> and his Magnaguard bodyguards. Maul engages the Magnaguards, easily defeating a group of four of the droids, before jumping to fight Grievous. After a short skirmish, Maul realizes that his forces have been overrun and are on the verge of losing. Maul calls in an airstrike to further damage Grievous' forces before jumping into another ship to be taken away off planet. As soon as the ship made orbit, Maul contacted his Mother the Nightsister <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mother-talzin/4005-89541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89541\">Mother Talzin</a>, as to what his next move should be.</p><p>Heeding her advice, he makes his way to a Black Sun stronghold on Ord Mantell and prepares the forces there to combat the Separatist forces he knew would follow him. Not soon afterwards, Grievous and Dooku would lead a Separatist attack on the stronghold. Due to his strategic planning, Maul was able to board the Separatist flagship, capture <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mother-talzin/4005-89541/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-89541\">General Grievous</a>, deactivate the droids attacking the city, and subsequently capture <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/count-dooku/4005-5392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Count Dooku</a>. Maul takes both the Count and the General to a near Mandalorian supply outpost and contacts his former Master, letting him know his armies would be crushed without his generals and that both him and Mother Talzin seek their revenge on him. Asking Dooku to join him against Sidious in order to take him down, Maul's base is suddenly attacked by Republic forces led by Masters <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and Tiplee. Realizing he had better chances teaming up with Maul than dying at his hands as a prisoner, Dooku and Maul attempt to engage the Jedi, only to be interrupted by Jedi reinforcements in the form of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mace-windu/4005-5395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\">Mace Windu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/aayla-secura/4005-5389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5389\">Aayla Secura</a>. After a brief duel between Windu, Secura, Maul, and Kenobi, Tiplee, and Dooku, Death Watch commandos intervene, shooting a jetpack missile at Maul's opponents, allowing Maul and Dooku to escape once again.</p><p>Now finally ready to implement his Mother's plan, Maul takes Dooku to Dathomir in hopes of drawing out his former Master for a final confrontation. Sidious arrives shortly afterwards, with the now escaped Grievous, and attempts to subdue Maul yet again. At this point, Mother Talzin enters Dooku's body via a dark side technique, and uses his body to duel Sidious as Maul engages Grievous. The four engage in a quick duel, which sees Sidious disarm Talzin-controlled-Dooku, before shocking the possessed Dooku with lightning to force Talzin to let go of Dooku's body and Maul Force-push Grievous out of a large hole in the wall. Talzin and Sidious enter in a Force Lightning match with neither gaining the advantage over the other, which allows Maul the chance to escape and make sure the Shadow Collective would still have a strong leader. Maul, although resisting at first, allows himself to leave Dathomir with his Death Watch allies, as Talzin is struck down by Grievous and Separatists forces launch a full-on assault on Dathomir.</p><h3>Capture</h3><p>During the last days of the clone wars, former Death Watch member Bo-Katan is able to appeal to the former Jedi Ahsoka Tano to help her retake Mandalore and capture Maul. Although reluctant at first, the Republic sends a faction of the 501st legion to help assist with the attack on Mandalore. The Republic and Bo-Katan's forces are able lay a siege on the capital of Mandalore trapping Maul inside. Maul however, had planned this as he had thought Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were leading the attack, and wanted to kill the pair to exact his revenge on both Kenobi and Sidious (who wanted Anakin as his apprentice). </p><p>After Prime Minister Almec was captured, Maul tells his loyal Mandalorian follower Gar Saxon to assassinate the Almec so that the former Prime Minister doesn't reveal any of Maul's plans to the Republic and Jedi. Towards the end of the siege, Maul is confronted by Ahsoka Tano. Although disappointed that Obi-Wan and Anakin didn't come to try and capture him like he had expected, he offers Ahsoka to join him to take down Sidious, and tells the former Togrutan Jedi that the galaxy was about to fall into darkness. Ahsoka nearly joins him, but is enraged when Maul tells her that her former master Anakin Skywalker would fall to the dark side, believing that Anakin wouldn't do such a thing. </p><p>The 2 begin fighting, with Ahsoka managing to kick Maul out a window. Maul then attempts to escape as his forces were being overrun by the Republic and Bo-Katan's men. As Saxon asks him for reinforcements, Maul declines and tells him to die well, infuriating Saxon and making him swear to kill Maul. Maul is soon confronted by Ahsoka again. He manages to disarm Tano, but loses his footing while attacking her and falls down towards the ground below. She is saved by Ahsoka, who chooses to capture him and loads him onto a Republic Gunship as the battle was winding down.</p><h3>Order 66</h3><p>As the Republic forces were returning towards Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine, now revealed to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious executed Order 66 after the death of Mace Windu. Ahsoka is able to survive her clones turning against her and escapes, releasing Maul to use him as a distraction on the clones. Maul makes his way towards the hangar bay, and despite not having his lightsaber, makes innovative use of the force, and is able to reach the hangar. As Maul runs towards a ship to escape, Ahsoka attacks him but he avoids her strikes, before force pushing Tano away. Maul then enters the ship and attempts to escape, but Ahsoka uses the force to lock it into place and starts trying to pull it back down. However, she is forced to release her hold on the ship as clones starts attacking her, which allows Maul to escape. </p><p> </p><h3>Facing Vader</h3><p>During the time of the Galactic Empire Maul returned, Maul was resurrected by the prophets of the Dark Side to prove that Maul was a better candidate for the Emperor than <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Vader</a>. The prophets brought Maul back to destroy Darth Vader because they had doubts about his commitment to the Dark Side of the Force. Although Maul proved a formidable opponent for Vader and demonstrated better skill with a lightsaber, Maul underestimated Vader's committment to the Dark Side. Vader proved that he was a fully committed Sith by stabbing through his own body to kill the Zabrak.</p><h2>Skills</h2><h3>Lightsaber and Martial Arts Mastery</h3><p>Darth Sidious trained Darth Maul mercilessly in all forms of the Sith arts, becoming the living embodiment of evil. Maul became a master of the seventh lightsaber form <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_VII:_Juyo_/_Vaapad\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Juyo</a>. Juyo was a form that allowed the user to harness their most volatile emotions into powerful, aggressive strikes intended to overwhelm an opponents defence and unbalance them. Because of this, the teaching of this form was banned by the Jedi order, as it opened doors to the dark side. Needless to say, Maul was able to maximize the effectiveness of Juyo by channelling his inner darkness, anger and hatred into the form, which, coupled with Maul's astonishing physical strength, and blinding speed, made him an overwhelmingly powerful opponent for even the strongest or most experienced Jedi.</p><p>Darth Maul formerly wielded a Saberstaff, or double-bladed lightsaber, which he crafted personally after his Sith Lord trials using four red synthetic focusing crystals. In order to use such a weapon the user had to be a true master combatant, and was required to be in perfect attunement with their blade, otherwise they had as much chance of cutting themselves in half as their opponent. Maul no doubt fit this description, as he knew his weapon intimately. The hilt was specifically fitted and weighted to his personal preference. He wielded it with true mastery. He would often only ignite one of the blades when facing a single opponent, but when faced with multiple opponents, ignited both blades. Sometimes, however, he ignited both blades purely to confuse opponents who were not familiar with the weapon's archaic design.</p><p>As a direct replacement for Dun Moch, Maul became a master practitioner of <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ter%C3%A4s_K%C3%A4si\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Teräs Käsi</a>. Teräs Käsi was an unarmed combat form originally designed by non-force sensitives in order for them to effectively combat Jedi. It's techniques are based on the movements and attacks of various predatory creatures from around the galaxy, such as Rancor Rising, Charging Wampa and Riding Bantha. As a result of Maul's mastery of Teras Kasi, he was able to constantly chain devastating leg, elbow and even head-horn strikes into his lightsaber combat, occasionally killing opponents on impact. Teras Kasi also allowed the practitioner to have full control over their body, which allowed Maul to adjust his body position during falls of up to 30 meters in order to dodge otherwise fatal obstacles. Maul had also mastered numerous other physical martial arts at around the age of thirteen during his training at Orsis Academy.</p><p>Maul had also mastered the dual blade sword technique <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jar'Kai\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Jar'Kai</a>, and became adept in the sixth lightsaber form, <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_VI:_Niman\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Niman</a>. He demonstrated this knowledge during his lightsaber duel against his former master, Darth Sidious, on Mandalore.</p><p>Maul showed proficiency in Dun Moch despite never being formally trained in the traditional Sith martial art. He used it against Obi-Wan Kenobi in their first duel since his return from his apparent death, allowing him to unbalance the Jedi and force him to retreat.</p><p>Maul at the age of three knew how to pinpoint the vulnerabilities of nearly every native species on Mustafar.</p><h3>Force Powers</h3><p>Maul became a powerful and well refined telekinetic after his return from Lotho Minor, and was stated as being more powerful in the Force than ever before. He is able to perform astonishing telekinetic feats such as collapsing massive amounts of debris from a cliff face, and blowing away a large company of soldiers with the aid of his brother, Savage. He was also able to carry out less destructive but far more intricate telekinetic manoeuvres, such as engineering the heart attack of an elderly man, and crushing his heart from the inside. Maul has also shown the ability to use telekinesis in order to perform supernatural feats of engineering, such as carrying out the equivalent of a mind trick on a droid, and constructing fully functioning spider-like legs for himself in seconds using various junked droid parts.</p><p>Maul was very proficient in the technique Force Choke, which he utilized numerous times against non-force sensitives as well as force sensitives, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi, with relative ease. He also showed great accuracy with the technique Saber Throw.</p><p>Maul has demonstrated an exceptionally advanced knowledge in mind tricks, being able to whisper commands into a soldier's ear, forcing him to walk up to his fellow soldier's and detonate a thermal detonator, killing himself and everyone around him. Maul has also used mind tricks in order to force people to lose interest in him, making him essentially invisible to the weak minded.</p><p>Force Powers</p><ul><li>Force Choke</li><li>Force Lightning</li><li>Force Grip</li><li>Force Repulse</li><li>Force Leap</li><li>Force Push</li><li>Force Saber Throw</li><li>Force Dash</li><li>Force Pull</li><li>Force Fire</li><li>Force Mind Trick</li><li>Force Freeze</li><li>Force Sense</li><li>Force Scream</li><li>Mechu-deru</li><li>Force Sight</li></ul><h3>Projectile Weaponry</h3><p>Maul, during his training at the Orsis Academy as well as with Sidious, learned how to use ranged weapons such as blasters and throwing knives with extraordinary accuracy, being able to hit targets blindfolded with ease, and having to deliberately miss during certain training exercises in order to avoid giving up his hidden identity as a Sith.</p><h3>Acrobatics</h3><p>Maul was trained to be a superb acrobat from as young as three years old. When he was this young he was already capable of running along walls, and was trained to run up walls and do somersaults. Soon he managed to master this exercise. He was further trained in advanced acrobatics on a variety of different planets with gravitational fields ranging from half, to twice as much as Maul was accustomed to on Coruscant normally. Nearer the end of his formal training he was capable of pulling off a triple backward flip, and willingly jumped fifty-five meters from a cruiser into the ocean. He also constantly chained acrobatic kicks into his fights.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><p>Because of the Sith Grand Plan, Maul had to be trained in the arts of stealth and espionage, to uphold the secrecy of the Sith's return from the Jedi. Maul was no doubt a master in these fields. He was able to move noiselessly as he assassinated opponents, and used the Force to cloak himself invisible in order to bypass enemies he could not afford to engage.</p><h3>Computer Hacking</h3><p>Maul was trained in advanced computer hacking, which has allowed him to access otherwise restricted files and databases on computers, on numerous occasions.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><p><b><a href=\"/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace/4025-64/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-64\">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535323\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.275\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2535323\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg 501w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2535323-maulfacereveal_tpm.jpg 501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Darth Maul made his first appearance Star Wars: TPM in 1999 and was played by Scottish Martial Artist and Stunt-Man Ray Park.

For A.I.M., Tarleton worked on experiments to unlock mental potential. Some sources say he volunteered and others say he was forced, but Tarleton became the next experiment.</p><p>After the transformation, he was to be known as M.O.D.O.C.: <strong>M</strong>ental <strong>O</strong>rganism <strong>D</strong>esigned <strong>O</strong>nly for <strong>C</strong>omputing. He quickly overthrew <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/aim/4060-13497/\">A.I.M.</a>, and became their commander. He was then known as M.O.D.O.K.: <strong>M</strong>ental <strong>O</strong>rganism <strong>D</strong>esigned <strong>O</strong>nly for <strong>K</strong>illing.

Doom turned on the group after acquiring ancient texts and spells, leaving M.O.D.O.K. and the Leader calling the shots. They were responsible for capturing <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> and Doctor Doom and have laid plans to capture the remaining 6 of the 8 smartest people on Earth. The plan is to absorb their knowledge and use it to their own advantage, afterward leaving the mindless husks to whatever the Wizard chooses to do with them. M.O.D.O.K. and Leader soon use a cathexis ray to transform all the heroes and their personal army, the <a href=\"/aimarines/4060-57517/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57517\">AIMarines</a>, into \"hulked-out\" versions of themselves. One of the heroes, Amedeus Cho, becomes infected himself, gaining the ability to warp reality in a 10 foot radius and becoming the smartest man in the world. He then uses his reality warping powers to turn M.O.D.O.K. back into George Tarleton, who then escapes.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>George Tarleton is subjected to a mutagenic process that grants him superhuman intelligence, including a computer-like memory, the ability to scour and retain large databanks of information very quickly and solve abstract mathematical problems nearly instantaneously. He also has the ability to calculate the mathematical probability of any given event occurring; an ability so strong that it borders on precognition. However, his creativity remains at average human level. As M.O.D.O.K., the character also has psionic powers enabling him to mentally control both individuals and large groups, and generate force fields able to withstand minor nuclear explosions. Courtesy of A.I.M. technology, M.O.D.O.K. wears a headband that enables him to focus his mental power into a devastating beam.</p><p>A side effect of the mutation was the growth of Tarleton's head to the point whereby his body can no longer support the weight, necessitating the use of an exoskeleton and hoverchair. The chair is equipped with a variety of weapons including missiles and lasers. Occasionally, Tarleton had the use of a giant humanoid vehicle that was proportionally sized to his head. Tarleton's organs also wear out quickly, necessitating the use of harvested clones, whose organs are used to sustain him.</p><p>As the leader of A.I.M., M.O.D.O.K. has advanced technology and a personal army at his disposal.</p><h3>Weaknesses</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1129090\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1129090-picture_2.png\" data-ratio=\"1.2458193979933\" data-width=\"598\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 598px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1129090-picture_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1129090\"><img alt=\"Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk 01\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1129090-picture_2.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1129090-picture_2.png 598w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" data-width=\"770\"></a><figcaption>Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk 01</figcaption></figure><p>M.O.D.O.K. is unable to move without his hover chair.

He broke out with all the other prisoners from all four superhero prisons during the first episode, using Graviton's fight with the Avengers to cover his escape. He would appear in later episodes of the first season where he has returned to A.I.M. after his escape from the Vault. He would become involved in transforming Simon Williams into Wonder Man as well as he &amp; A.I.M. becoming involved in a war with Baron Strucker and HYDRA over the Cosmic Cube, which A.I.M was commissioned to create for HYDRA, but decided to keep for themselves for their own purposes telling Strucker that the Cosmic Cube creation was a failure. A mini war broke out between the two criminal organizations when HYDRA learned that the Cosmic Cube was in fact functional and still in A.I.M's possession. M.O.D.O.C. is last seen being attacked and apparently destroyed by HYDRA controlled Dreadnaughts designed to neutralize his mental abilities.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Nathaniel Richards was born in the year 3000 A.D. of an alternate reality dubbed Earth-6311, or counter-earth, that never went through the dark ages. Named after his alleged ancestor who had brought peace and prosperity to the planet, Nathaniel attended robotics school as a child. An exceptionally bright student, he was bullied constantly. When he was sixteen, a bully slashed his throat, causing him to miss a year of school while recuperating.</p><p>It was during this time that Kang become obsessed with adventure, watching historical videos from his family archives. Nathan was particularly fascinated with the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, a team lead by a distant relative of his, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>. Nathaniel longed for adventure.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Kang the conqueror was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>. Kang made his first comic book appearance in the pages of <a href=\"/fantastic-four-prisoners-of-the-pharoah/4000-6735/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-6735\">Fantastic Four #19</a> though it was in his Rama-Tut persona. Kang the conqueror made his first appearance in the pages of <a href=\"/the-avengers-kang-the-conqueror/4000-7302/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-7302\">Avengers #8</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Kang has traveled to many timelines, one of the first in which he takes on the mantle of Rama Tut back in ancient Egypt. In another timeline he becomes The Scarlet Centurion, and far in the future he becomes Immortus.</p><h3>Rama-Tut</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-891836\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/891836-440px_rama_tut.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56136363636364\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35816/891836-440px_rama_tut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-891836\"><img alt=\"Rama-Tut\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35816/891836-440px_rama_tut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/35816/891836-440px_rama_tut.jpg 440w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35816/891836-440px_rama_tut.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Rama-Tut</figcaption></figure><p>At the age of 25, Nathaniel discovered the remains of a time machine in the archives of a famous ancestor. Using his scientific genius to restore the device, Nathaniel adopted the mantle of Rama-Tut and built a time machine in the shape of the ancient Sphinx in order to capitalize on the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. Though Nathaniel was temporarily blinded when his ship crashed, he used his far flung futuristic technology to subjugate the Egyptian people. Rama Tut ruled for 10 years before being run out of Egypt by a combination of losses to a young <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">En Saba Nur</a> (the mutant who would one day become known as Apocalypse) and The Fantastic Four (which was led, oddly enough, by Rama's own ancestor.)</p><p>Rama Tut fled to the future, but a time storm (which was later revealed to be the work of his possible future self, Immortus) interfered with his travel and stranded him in the 20th century. There he aided a space-lost <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> (another possible ancestor of his) and convinced him that they might actually be the same man. Some time after, Rama Tut had a short run in with the time-traveling mutant <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a>. Defeated, Tut escaped into the time-stream.</p><h3>Kang the Conqueror</h3><p>It was in his 35th year of life that Nathaniel Richards first diverged. When entering the timestream, one divergence of Nathaniel Richards ended up in an alternate 20th century, where he took over that Earth under the guise of the Scarlet Centurion; The other divergence found himself in the war-torn 40th century. Inspired by his meeting with his possible ancestor, Nathaniel constructed his own body suit from a futuristic 40th century metallic alloy, and conquered that planet. On that day, Kang the Conqueror was born.</p><p>Kang returned to the 20th century; various sources conflict on whether the Conqueror wished to challenge The Fantastic Four or his ancestor Doctor Doom. Unfortunately for the conqueror, he found neither, and was defeated by the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>; this affront would earn the Avengers the eternal enmity of Kang.</p><p>Later, Kang went through time to the moment that his throat was about to be slashed. He stopped the incident, and showed his younger self what he would one day become. The young Kang did, however not want to become this. He fled to the twenty first century, where he tried to contact the Avengers for help. Upon not being able to reach them, he formed the Young Avengers to get their attention. This endeavor ended, because young Kang realized that he was destroying the time-line.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Celestial Madonna</h3><p><b>For More Information:</b> <b>Celestial Madonna</b>, <a href=\"/the-avengers/4050-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2128\"><b>Avengers</b></a></p><p>In <strong>Avengers Vol.1 #129-135 and giant Sized Avengers #2-4</strong>, Kang kidnaps Mantis, the Scarlet Witch, and Agatha Harkness to determine which will give birth to a being of great power.</p><h3>Infinity War</h3><p><b>For More Information:</b> <b>Infinity War</b></p><p>During the <a href=\"/\">Infinity War</a>, Kang teamed up with Doctor Doom in order to steal a collection of <a href=\"/\">Cosmic Cubes</a> from <a href=\"/\">Adam Warlock's</a> evil side, the <a href=\"/\">Magus</a>. It was an unsteady alliance, both needing each others knowledge and technology, but both planning on betraying one another. They nearly succeeded in defeating the Magus on their own, but Doom was the first to betray. Doom was almost victorious but was defeated by the Magus when the <a href=\"/\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> he had obtained was activated by <a href=\"/\">Eternity</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p><b>For More Information:</b> <b>War Of Kings</b>, <a href=\"/realm-of-kings/4045-55932/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55932\"><b>Realm Of Kings</b></a></p><p>When <a href=\"/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a> detonated the Terrigen Bomb during the <a href=\"/war-of-kings/4045-55758/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55758\">War of Kings</a> this caused changes throughout time that Kang could not ignore. The explosion created the <a href=\"/the-fault/4020-56597/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56597\">Fault</a>, a massive fissure that would consume all of reality. It was not this that concerned Kang, but the fact that Adam Warlock stopped it's spreading. To do so, Adam overlapped an unused future over his time, a future in which he became the Magus. This caused all possible futures to be Magus futures.</p><p>Kang, assisted by dozens of <a href=\"/starhawk/4005-2168/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2168\">Starhawk's</a> whose time-lines had been destroyed, saved members of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/4060-25956/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25956\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. He chose <a href=\"/starlord/4005-10957/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10957\">Starlord</a> to help deal with the Magus problem, as it would be easily detected were Kang himself to try. Kang gave Starlord the last Cosmic Cube. He would send them to moments before Adam's transformation and the cube would create a local time flow hiatus, extending the time to stop Adam from becoming the Magus by a few more minutes. He told Starlord to do whatever it takes to save the universe. Starlord did do whatever it takes and using the cube changed the Magus back into Adam and killed him.</p><h3>Marvel Now!</h3><h4>Ragnarok Now</h4><p>Kang kidnaps the Apocalypse twins (<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/uriel/4005-88224/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88224\">Uriel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eimin/4005-88225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88225\">Eimin</a>) the children of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Archangel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/pestilence-ichisumi/4005-74592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74592\">Pestilence (Ichisumi)</a> to serve in a part of an elaborate scheme. After he takes the new born babies,he raises them in the future to hate humans by sending them to the red skull's mutant concentration camps.</p><p>Raised believing that humans are the enemies of mutants and the only way to save their people (the mutants) is to take them and leave the planet, therefore allowing Kang to rule without having any mutant enemy. The Apocalypse Twins agreed to take their people away, however their hatred of Kang made them scheme for revenge as well, so when they escaped to the past, they took the enchanted axe Jarnbjorn to blame man kind for the death of Celestials so the the Celestials would destroy Kang's kingdom.</p><p>After Havok destroyed the tachyon dam Kang and a group of allies he had collected from the 7 prime times came to save the Earth by sending the remaining members of the Unity Squad to the past.</p><p>After <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor </a>stopped Existar, Kang shows up and proclaims that this was always his plan, he will absorb the soul of Existar and rule everything.</p><p>The Unity Squad with the help of Immortus and the Infinity Watch managed to stop him, but before defeating him, Kang disappears and tells Havok that all is lost now.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Kang ages at a slower rate than modern humanity, increasing his longevity. Kang is an expert of time travel and manipulation of space-time. He has mastered advanced technology and is presumed to have above average intelligence. He is an expert strategist for whom struggle is a necessity. His will is supposedly \"indomitable\". He is a veteran of armed and unarmed combat through numerous eras and time-lines.</p><p>Kang wears a full-body armor which enhances his strength. He is able to lift c. 5 tons when wearing the armor. The armor can project a force field covering a circle twenty feet around its user. The force field is durable enough to protect its user from direct nuclear strikes. The suit is supplied with air, food and water, allowing him to survive for quite a while before exhausting his resources. It comes with its own waste disposal system. The armor is equipped with various weapons, including \"anti-graviton particle projectors in his gauntlets, concussive force blasters, circuitry accessing his ship's time machine, allowing him an \"automatic recall\" of a few seconds\" and others. Kang has even demonstrated technology transferring his mind to alternate bodies when a body of his dies. He might thus extend his life indefinitely.</p><p>Kang typically carries various weapons, such as an anti-matter defense screen generator, a \"vibration-ray\" projector, an electromagnetic field-amplifier, neutrino-ray warhead missile launcher (hand-gun size), electrical paralysis generator, nerve gas sprayer, and a molecular expander. Kang commands a vast armada of warriors from across the galaxy of his future era. He uses numerous robots, most notably his Growing-Man stimuloids, packed with the \"Growth Pollen\" of the world Kosmos, which causes them to grow in size and strength by absorbing kinetic energy.</p><p>Kang maintains strongholds in various alternate realities. His primary base used to be Chronopolis, a fortress serving as a crossroads to every era in human history but itself outside the time-stream and undetectable. The palace and its inhabitants were immune to the passage of time. This base was destroyed in conflict with Immortus, an alternate version of Kang. Kang can presumably recreate it at some point.</p><p>Kang has created a device that allows him to alter a time-line without causing that time-line to divert into a different one, with the use of this machine he was able to construct Chronopolis.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-9997</h3><p>In the Earth X reality Kang was using the Immortus guise.</p><h3>Earth-6311</h3><p>The various Kangs in each reality combine: Rama-Tut, Kang, Scarlet Centurion and Immortus, they all converge into one reality.</p><h3>Earth-267</h3><p>Kang destroyed the Avengers.</p><h3>Earth-86501</h3><p>The Avengers almost got destroyed by a nuke that killed Kang instead.</p><h3>Earth-1610</h3><p>In the Ultimate Universe, Kang is a female character, who claims to have a plan to prevent the Earth's destruction. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">The Hulk</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> are recruited by her as part of her plan to steal the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> and also the destroy the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/triskelion/4020-55727/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55727\">Triskelion</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4><a href=\"/fantastic-four/4050-84326/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-84326\">Fantastic Four </a>(1967)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932929\" data-ratio=\"0.74183976261128\" data-width=\"674\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 674px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932929\"><img alt=\"Rama-Tut in the animated series\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg 674w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932929-rama-tat.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Rama-Tut in the animated series</figcaption></figure><p>Kang made an appearance as Rama-Tut in the 1967 animated series, voiced by Mike Road. He first appeared in the episode \"Rama-Tut,\" which adapted his first encounter with the Fantastic Four.</p><p>In the episode, the Fantastic Four decide to go back in time to the 10th century in order to find a cure for Ben Grimm's condition, where they are captured by Rama-Tut. He explains that he comes from the year 3000, a peaceful and enlightened time. Bored by his idyllic existence, he traveled back in time to ancient Egypt, but became stranded after his equipment was damaged. Rama-Tut enslaves the Fantastic Four, but the heroes are able to escape and free the rest of his thralls. Panicking, he attempts to flee in his damaged time machine, which explodes. The heroes are left wondering if Rama-Tut perished, or if he managed to escape before the explosion.</p><h4>X-Men: the Animated Series (1997)</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1923150\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.590625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1923150\"><img alt=\"Immortus' cameo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Immortus' cameo\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/97623/1923150-immortus.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Immortus' cameo</figcaption></figure><p>Kang was briefly shown (as Immortus) in \"Beyond Good and Evil Part II.\" He was shown at the Axis of Time posing as the enigmatic janitor following behind <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/bishop/4005-1503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1503\">Bishop</a> and showing him the different things going on in Earth-616s timeline.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-avengers-united-they-stand/4075-122/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-122\">Avengers: United They Stand </a>(1999)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623290\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623290\"><img alt=\"Kang in the 90's Avengers show\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg 384w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kang in the 90's Avengers show\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg 384w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623290-kangtrap.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kang in the 90's Avengers show</figcaption></figure><p>Kang appeared in the episode \"Kang,\" voiced by Ken Kramer.

Kang is depicted in much the same way as he is in the comics, a brutal, totalitarian dictator from the 40th century, whose timeline is rapidly being erased due to an unknown event changing the past. As such, Kang visits the past under the belief that the Captain's fate is the cause of the temporal disturbances, and upon discovering that Cap's resurrection will effectively wipe out his time line, Kang orders an immediate jump of the Damocles time ship to the 21st century, hoping to prevent the change from happening. During the process however, Kang's wife, Princess Ravonna, is exposed to chronal energies, causing her to be trapped in a state of temporal flux that will erase her from existence. Motivated by the fate of Ravonna, Kang states to save the future, he must conquer the past.</p><p>Kang returns in the three-part episodes \"The Man Who Stole Tomorrow,\" \"Come the Conqueror\" and \"The Kang Dynasty\" where he engages Captain America and Iron Man at Avengers Mansion, stating that the Avengers' attempts to stop him are \"primitive\" and \"amusing\" due to his advanced technology. Kang's abilities especially frustrate Iron Man, as his own understanding of Kang's weaponry are hindered by the technical constraints of the 21st century. When the other Avengers appear, Kang transports them 10 years into the future where he reveals that Captain America is presumably responsible for the destruction of humanity, as his actions in the upcoming Kree-Skrull war will end up causing the sun to be destroyed and end all life on Earth. Unwilling to let Kang kill Captain America and conquer Earth, the Avengers distract Kang while Iron Man hacks Kang's floating throne, eventually managing to bring everyone back to the present. Defeated, Kang transports back to the Damocles and prepares his fleet to invade Earth. In \"Come the Conqueror,\" the Avengers oppose Kang's army and allow Iron Man to find his ship. In \"The Kang Dynasty,\" the Avengers manage to board Kang's ship in an effort to stop the invasion forces by destroying the Damocles' engine core. Ultimately, Kang engages the Avengers and an <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> Synthezoid near the ship's time drive until Iron Man hacks Kang's technology and orders Ultron to transport the Damocles back to the 40th century. However, Wasp arrives in time to explain that Princess Ravonna will die if the ship is returned to it's former time. In the aftermath of the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. acquires the Damocles base while Hank Pym and Mister Fantastic are shown looking for a way to keep Ravonna alive. Kang, defeated and stripped of his empire, is remanded to Prison 42, proclaiming that the future will still end, and that it is all Captain America's fault.</p><p>In season 2, he was freed by representatives of the Council of Kangs and fought the Avengers again as well as the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a> (a team made up of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">the Thing</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a> and<a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\"> Iron Fist</a>), but was defeated in the end.</p><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/avengers-assemble/4075-19/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-19\">Avengers Assemble </a>(2016)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932960\" data-ratio=\"0.74074074074074\" data-width=\"270\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 270px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932960\"><img alt=\"Kang in Avengers Assemble\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-width=\"270\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg 270w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kang in Avengers Assemble\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932960-9033117668-av33..jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-width=\"270\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kang in Avengers Assemble</figcaption></figure><p>Kang appears in the third season, voiced by <a href=\"/steven-blum/4040-69073/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69073\">Steven Blum</a>.

His father was <a href=\"/colonel-fritz-klaue/4005-44592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44592\">Fritz Klaue</a>, an operative for Nazi Germany during World War II. Fritz crashed landed in <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a> and sought to murder his way to obtaining the rare metal Vibranium from the people of that nation, but his deadly mission failed.</p><p>Ulysses grew up and became a physicist working on applied sonics in Rotterdam and the Belgium city of Antwerpen, which eventually led to him developing a sound converter. Discovering this technology needed vibranium to work, Ulysses traveled to Wakanda, following in his father's footsteps in killing their people when they refused to hand over the precious ore. During the battle, <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">T'Challa</a> blasted off Klaw's right hand with one of Klaw's sound weapons. Years later, Klaw returned to Wakanda again, and hooked up his new sound converter machine to the vibranium. This machine was able to create solid creatures from sound, and he used them to battle the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> and T'Challa (now the Black Panther). Things went badly for Klaw and his machinery is overloaded by Black Panther. Trapped in a cave, Klaw jumped into his machine and became a being of solidified sound.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/135804-130681-klaw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-135804\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.4625\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/135804-130681-klaw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-135804\"><img alt=\"Kirby's Klaw\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/135804-130681-klaw.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5586/135804-130681-klaw.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/135804-130681-klaw.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Kirby's Klaw</figcaption></figure><p>Klaw first appeared in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fantastic-four-53-the-way-it-began/4000-8732/\">Fantastic Four #53 - The Way It Began</a> in August 1966 and was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Klaw's origin has recently been ret-conned by <a href=\"/reginald-hudlin/4040-41772/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41772\">Reggie Hudlin</a> in the <a href=\"/black-panther/4050-11502/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11502\">Black Panther</a> series. In this version, his great-great-great grandfather was one of the founders of South Africa, whom <a href=\"/\">T'Chaka</a> killed in a fight. Klaw is now an assassin, hired to kill him. Ulysses Klaw, a Dutch scientist, had developed a weapon that could turn sound into solid objects - as before, it needed only <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a> to work finally. Klaw makes his move at a global economic conference where plenty of 'potential employers' gathered. When Klaw realizes no deal is going to be made, he takes action, managing to kill the Panther. During his escape, Black Panther's son <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">T'Challa</a> blasts Klaw's hand off and severely injures Ulysses. After having his half-dead body experimented on for close to a decade, Klaw returns to being an assassin. With a gun attached to his hand, and Vibranium from the black market, he returns to Wakanda ten years later, as before, attacking <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a> and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Fantastic Four and Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192201\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99457504520796\" data-width=\"553\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 553px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192201\"><img alt=\"Klaw and the Masters of Evil\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 553w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Klaw and the Masters of Evil\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 553w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/64409/1192201-mastersultron1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Klaw and the Masters of Evil</figcaption></figure><p>Seeking revenge for his defeat in Wakanda, Klaw travels to New York to the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a> and attacks the Fantastic Four, but is beaten and put in prison. Klaw is then rescued by <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/4005-22613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22613\">Crimson Cowl</a>, and joins the <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a> in a plot to capture the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. They are successful, although the Avengers later escape with the help of the <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\">Black Knight</a>, and defeat Klaw and his allies.</p><p>Klaw then escapes and attempts to reform a small band of the Masters of Evil, who try to kidnap a famous scientist, but they are foiled by the Avengers and <a href=\"/lady-liberators/4060-46791/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46791\">Lady Liberators</a>.</p><p>Klaw would continue to battle the Black Panther in several different clashes - first in trying to steal the Vibrotron device from Wakanda, and then with the help of <a href=\"/solarr/4005-13849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13849\">Solarr</a> trying to con Black Panther and the Avengers into handing control of Wakanda to him. His hatred for T'Challa has grown during each battle that has ended with his defeat.</p><h3>Savage Land</h3><p>Klaw reemerges when an alien Sheenarian named <a href=\"/shauran/4005-35782/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35782\">Shauran</a> asks for his help in opening a portal for an invasion of Earth. Klaw starts by attacking <a href=\"/ka-zar/4005-3558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3558\">Ka-Zar</a> in London, England, but is driven off and then goes to the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a> where he helps the aliens begin their invasion. Ka-Zar and his tiger <a href=\"/zabu/4005-3537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3537\">Zabu</a> are able to turn the tables on Klaw and force him to return through the portal with the aliens. Klaw eventually finds a way to transport himself back to Earth.</p><h3>Molecule Man and Mad Thinker</h3><p>Klaw then finds <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a>’s wand in Florida after <a href=\"/man-thing/4005-4988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4988\">Man-Thing</a> drops it. Molecule Man and Klaw fight, then team up to battle the <a href=\"/impossible-man/4005-7590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7590\">Impossible Man</a> and Fantastic Four in New York. The Impossible Man and Klaw create constructs that explode when they battle, knocking out Klaw.</p><p>Klaw returns with the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\">Mad Thinker</a> with a scheme to trick <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a> into beating the Fantastic Four with a set of sound construct FF members and a construct <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> that is apparently kidnapped. Vision breaks free of the villains’ programming and together with the real Fantastic Four defeats Klaw.</p><h3>Project: PEGASUS</h3><p>Klaw ends up in <a href=\"/project-pegasus/4020-44379/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44379\">Project Pegasus</a>, where fellow inmate Solarr freed him, but both villains are defeated by a band of heroes including <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Giant Man</a>, the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a> and <a href=\"/quasar/4005-3319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3319\">Quasar</a>.</p><p>Klaw’s next scheme, when revived by an unsuspecting cleaning lady, is to start mining on a Native American reservation, where a confrontation with <a href=\"/ward-strongbow/4005-60646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60646\">Ward</a> and <a href=\"/american-eagle/4005-41819/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41819\">Jason Strongbow</a> results in them gaining powers from the radioactive rocks and Klaw’s sonic blasts. Klaw flees to the Savage Land to go after Vibranium again, but despite some dinosaurs used for protection, the Thing, <a href=\"/wyatt-wingfoot/4005-10275/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10275\">Wyatt Wingfoot</a> and Ka-Zar are able to knock him out and he is put back in Project: PEGASUS.</p><p>Soon after, Klaw found a way to escape by tricking <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a>, but is trounced by the new superhero and he is dissipated once again .</p><h3>Secret Wars</h3><p>In the series \" <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a>\" Klaw is resurrected by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> after being brought to Battleworld on board <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>' ship and is given the power to make real things out of sound, not just images. At the end of that series, he was presumed dead after being used by Doom and battling all the assembled heroes and then disappearing in an energy blast.</p><h3>Frightful Four</h3><p>Back on Earth somehow, Klaw seeks out <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>’s help but ends up fighting him and is disrupted when led into a tone generator. He then joins the <a href=\"/frightful-four/4060-11439/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11439\">Frightful Four</a>, led by the <a href=\"/wizard/4005-3287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3287\">Wizard</a>. The villains fight the Fantastic Four but are driven off back to their base. The Fantastic Four surprisingly pursue them there and the fight is rejoined. <a href=\"/aron-the-rogue-watcher/4005-11845/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11845\">Aron the Watcher</a> and <a href=\"/dragon-man/4005-6823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6823\">Dragon Man</a> enter the fray and the Fantastic Four are beaten. At that time, <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/4005-20604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20604\">Sharon Ventura</a> had taken Thing's place on the Fantastic Four, and Ben Grimm had just been returned to his human form. Ben manages to help free the heroes and they beat the Frightful Four, only for Aron to transport both teams to another dimension, with clones taking their place. When the original characters eventually return, the Frightful Four are beaten again and sent to <a href=\"/the-vault/4020-43582/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43582\">the Vault</a> by Aron.</p><p>Klaw then struggled for a while, fighting Quasar, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and the Avengers in successive breakouts, but is sent back to the Vault. He is briefly used by <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">AIM</a> to apprehend the Molecule Man and <a href=\"/volcana/4005-14536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14536\">Volcana</a> but manages to free himself from AIM's control. He also popped up again when <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> investigated an AIM Weapons Expo on Boca Caliente Island. When he returns to attack Wakanda again with a new army of mercenaries, Black Panther calls in the help of the Fantastic Four and he is returned to jail again.</p><h3>West Coast Avengers and Doctor Demonicus</h3><p>When <a href=\"/doctor-demonicus/4005-4106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4106\">Dr. Demonicus</a> raises an island called Demonica, he enlists Klaw, freeing him from Wakanda. The <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/4060-29075/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-29075\">West Coast Avengers</a> battle Klaw and <a href=\"/morning-star/4005-42916/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42916\">Zvezda</a> and are imprisoned by Klaw. A battle then breaks out between <a href=\"/raksasa/4005-42920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42920\">Raksasa</a> - the demon who was actually controlling the other villains - and the Avengers and the <a href=\"/pacific-overlords/4060-42561/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42561\">Pacific Overlords</a>. Klaw and Zvezda decide to join the heroes, and help them win through but Klaw is swept away in a rockslide when the island sinks.</p><h3>A New Frightful Four</h3><p>Reappearing once again, Klaw, <a href=\"/huntara/4005-11860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11860\">Huntara</a>, <a href=\"/paibok-the-power-skrull/4005-11524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11524\">Paibok</a> and <a href=\"/devos-the-devastator/4005-11857/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11857\">Devos</a> coincidentally attack the Fantastic Four at the same time, with the group already undergoing some internal strife. The fight grows to involve <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a> and <a href=\"/silver-sable/4005-7608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\">Silver Sable</a> as well as a group of Avengers, forcing the villains back to Paibok’s ship. Later, when the four villains return, Paibok and Devos abscond with the Fantastic Four to space, while Klaw encounters <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/4005-20604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20604\">Sharon Ventura</a> in her Thing form held in stasis. Klaw later returns and kidnaps Sharon and enlists her into a new Frightful Four led by the Wizard. But when Klaw is sent to the Baxter Building to attack <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Ant-Man</a> he is defeated and runs away.</p><p>Klaw attacks Black Panther again when the hero comes to New York but is beaten by <a href=\"/vibraxas/4005-11460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11460\">Vibraxas</a>, Huntara, <a href=\"/devlor/4005-11862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11862\">Devlor</a> and an adult Franklin Richards as <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Psi-Lord</a>. He tries to beat Black Panther again with the help of <a href=\"/erik-killmonger/4005-6111/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6111\">Killmonger</a>, but this time Daredevil helps knock him out. He even tried teaming up with Black Panther's cousin Joshua Itobo to get to Wakanda's Vibranium again, but was stopped by <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">Cable</a> who was visiting Black Panther at the time.</p><h3>Masters of Evil and Thunderbolts</h3><p>Klaw joins a Masters of Evil team led by <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/4005-22613/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22613\">Crimson Cowl</a>, along with <a href=\"/man-killer/4005-14575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14575\">Man-Killer</a>, <a href=\"/flying-tiger/4005-24381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24381\">Flying Tiger</a>, <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a>, and <a href=\"/cyclone/4005-14451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14451\">Cyclone</a>. A first meeting with the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> and <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> sees them retreat for a time. In their next encounter, Klaw traps the Thunderbolts in a sonic bubble and knocks out <a href=\"/songbird/4005-3281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3281\">Songbird</a> with a sonic blast. This time the Masters win and offer the Thunderbolts a place on their team.

He created Klaw copies from himself to work for him in an attempt to build an antenna to bring the real Klaw back from space. Daredevil escapes the machine, and destroys the antenna before the Klaws can complete it.

The first king of Wakanda, Black Panther Bashenga, harnessed the mineral and used it to nurture his nation. Thousands of years later, under the ruling of Black Panther <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tchaka/4005-62659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62659\">T‘Chaka</a>, Wakanda's level of technological and economic achievements continued to excel far beyond those of the modern world.</p><p>T'Chaka concealed Wakanda from the rest of world to prevent it from being manipulated by outsiders. His first wife, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nyami/29-70733/\">N'Yami</a>, died while in labor with Prince T’Challa. Years later, a Dutch scientist named Ulysses <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a> found a way into Wakanda, created a vibranium sound-based weapon, and used it to kill King T’Chaka. Prince T’Challa, only a child at the time, managed to turn the sound weapon on Klaw, destroying his right hand. Klaw fled the country, exposed Wakanda to the outside world, and vowed revenge.</p><p>Prince T'Challa would later become king after defeating his uncle, King <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/syan/4005-59942/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59942\">S'yan</a>, in a once-a-year ritual that allowed anyone of Wakandan royalty to become king/queen by defeating the current ruler in hand-to-hand combat. Given the fact that the ruling Black Panther possessed enhanced and superhuman abilities from digesting the Wakandan <a href=\"/heart-shaped-herb/4055-43809/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43809\">Heart-shaped Herb</a>, the chance of an average man defeating a Black Panther was slim. However, T’Challa succeeded. He also digested the Heart-shaped Herb, which gave him superhuman senses and provided him with enhanced agility, strength, and over all physical capability.</p><h2><strong>Creation</strong></h2><p>The Black Panther was created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>.

Using his superhuman senses of sight, smell, and hearing combined with his enhanced panther-like reflexes, he divided his time as a king and crime fighter. During the characters first debut, Stan Lee scribes the African hero defeating the American superhero team, the Fantastic Four.</p><p>Several years later, in 1968, <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a> scribes the character's first appearance as an <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avenger</a>. In 1972, after the first four issues, the Black Panther becomes the titular character of <a href=\"/don-mcgregor/4040-44540/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44540\">Don McGregor</a>'s <em>Jungle Action</em>. McGregor's \"<a href=\"/panthers-rage/4045-55776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55776\">Panther's Rage</a>\" is one of the most critically acclaimed stories of the Black Panther mythos. The co-creator of the Black Panther, Jack Kirby, would later go on to illustrate and scribe the hero's solo series in 1977.</p><p>In 1998, <a href=\"/christopher-priest/4040-41500/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41500\">Christopher Priest</a> began writing the Black Panther's following series. Priest modernized the character by building and expanding upon the Black Panther mythos mapped out by Lee and McGregor. In Priest's retcons of Wakanda, he established Bastet (the ancient Egyptian God) as the panther god that the Wakandans built their religious cult of the Black Panther around. Prior to this retcon, the Wakandan panther god did not have a name/origin. Priest's interpretation of the Black Panther is widely praised.</p><p>In 2005, TV/movie scribe <a href=\"/reginald-hudlin/4040-41772/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41772\">Reginald Hudlin</a> began writing the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure retconned a lot of what was previously established about the character, as he rebooted the heroes adventures. However, major establishments, like T'Challa being a warrior king, all stayed true to the classic tales of the Black Panther. Hudlin's tenure on the Black Panther is the most commercially successful series of the Black Panther franchise. He also created <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a>, T'Challa's younger sister, who he would later scribe becoming the new Black Panther in 2009.</p><h2><strong>Major Story Arcs</strong></h2><h3>Defeating The Fantastic Four</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3205056\" data-ratio=\"0.97376093294461\" data-width=\"343\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 343px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3205056\"><img alt=\" Pledging his \"fortune, powers, and life to the service of all mankind.\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg 343w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3205056-9399327146-FF53_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Pledging his \"></noscript></a><figcaption> Pledging his \"fortune, powers, and life to the service of all mankind.\"</figcaption></figure><p>To test his powers, fighting skill, and genius, King T'Challa invited the American superhero team, the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a>, to Wakanda. The FF were amazed at the Wakandan man-made \"techno jungle\", commenting on how amazingly real it seemed. Although Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) knew it was man-made.</p><p>The Black Panther then attacked, neutralized, and defeated the Fantastic Four individually by using a combination of technology, built into his panther costume, and his superhuman panther like abilities, which he explained came from eating a rare herb and secret Wakandan spirit rituals. T'he Panther later revealed himself to be King T'Challa and apologized for attacking them. He explained that he wanted to test their abilities to see if they would make effective allies against <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/klaw/4005-3171/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3171\">Klaw </a>and his mercenaries. They all became fast friends and allies.</p><p>Elsewhere, Klaw returned to Wakanda and began attempting to invade the country. He wanted to use Wakanda's rare substance, called vibranium, to turn sound into a weapon. With the help of the Fantastic Four and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wakandan-military/4060-58320/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58320\">Wakandan Military</a>, T'Challa was able to defeat Klaw and his enforcement. T'Challa realized, the more Wakanda continued to excel into a technological powerhouse, the more grave the threats of world would bring his kingdom. He then pledged his fortune, his powers, and life \"to the service of all mankind.\"</p><p>After this adventure, T'Challa teamed up with <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\">Sharon Carter</a> in order to defeat an impostor posing as the deceased <a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Zemo</a>.

Unsure if they were a threat to humanity of not, T'Challa decided to investigate the group of super-humans by infiltrating their rankings.</p><p>When the Black Panther traveled to <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avenger's Mansion</a>, he snuck into the facility only to find that the Avengers were dead! <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/jasper-sitwell/4005-7529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7529\">Jasper Sitwell</a> walked in moments later and by the looks of it, T'Challa had killed <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>, and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>. It is later revealed that the \"<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/grim-reaper/4005-7227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7227\">Grim Reaper</a>\" had put the Avenger's trio in a death like stasis, framing the Black Panther. The Panther managed to defeat him and rescue the Avenger's trio. He was then offered membership to the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, which he happily accepted. T'Challa would go on to have many adventures with the Avengers, becoming a veteran member, all whilst ruling to his kingdom.

In an attempt to console the young child’s family, he traveled to New York to investigate the situation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Micheal Achebe, a citizen of a neighboring Wakandan country called Ghudaza, initiated a coup d'état becoming Wakanda's usurper. Ghudaza was a midst a civil war and T’Challa protected some of its citizens by allowing them to live in Wakandan refugee camps. <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/achebe/4005-19911/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19911\">Achebe </a>lived in one of those camps, which gave him access to Wakanda.

In return, Mephisto would get to devour a “noble soul”. After uncovering Mephisto's involvement, T'Challa attacked him, ripping out the demon's heart. He was then transported to \"hell\" where he offered his own soul in exchange for Wakanda and Achebe's freedom, under the impression that Mephisto was possessing Achebe.</p><p>Mephisto accepted the offer, but revealed that Achebe willing sold his soul to him. Mephisto proceeded to try to devour T’Challa’s soul, but was unsuccessful because of the Panther God’s spiritual connection. Hundreds of previous Wakandan kings appeared before them in the form of actual panthers. The panthers then attacked and entrapped Mephisto in hell, as T’Challa escaped to hunt down Achebe.</p><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4826156\" data-ratio=\"2.0847058823529\" data-width=\"425\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 425px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:208.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4826156\"><img alt=\"Black Panther's Marvel Knights look\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg 425w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther's Marvel Knights look\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg 425w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4826156-1106154827-1326..jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Panther's Marvel Knights look</figcaption></figure><p>After T’Challa attempted to make contact with Wakanda, via satellite, Achebe threatened to destroy all of Wakandan if he were to ever return home. As a result, T’Challa was exiled from Wakanda with the Wakandan citizens accepting Achebe as usurper due to conditions within Wakandan law. T’Challa remained stateside in New York, attempting to uncover Achebe’s other allies, because he knew that Achebe wasn't working alone. It is later revealed that Achebe was working with the United States intelligence community, Russia, and the Latin-American terrorist state, Domuyan, in an attempt to exploit Wakanda’s vast technological advancements. However, King T'Challa had predicted that this would happen years prior, but was uncertain which of the three countries would initiate the attack first. He quickly began a counter maneuver.</p><p>T’Challa presented the coup d'état to the U.N. Security Council and acknowledged it as an act of war against Wakanda, verbally declaring war against the United States. Afterwards, he and the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dora-milaje/4060-55780/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55780\">Dora Milaje</a>, along with Monica Lynne, were approached by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/white-wolf/4005-11458/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11458\">Hunter the White Wolf</a>, who wanted to help T'Challa take back Wakanda. A midst conversing about a potential team up, they were all separated by a surprise attack by the US &amp; Russian secret services.</p><p>Elsewhere, after hearing that T’Challa verbally denounced war against the United States, Achebe began destroying Wakanda, with its own technology, to prove to T’Challa that he was in control of the country. Also, hundreds of Ghudazai soldiers invaded Wakanda under the order of Achebe. Back in New York,<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/monica-lynne/4005-11002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11002\"> Monica Lynne</a> (T’Challa’s ex-fiancé) was attacked by the Russian mob after T’Challa and Hunter went off to fight the secret service. The Dora Milaje, however, were able to protect her.</p><p>Hunter is 12 years older than T’Challa. As a baby, he was the lone survivor of a plane crash that landed outside of Wakanda. He was then raised and declared a Wakandan citizen by King T’Chaka (T’Challa’s father). He became the leader of Wakanda’s secret police, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hatut-zeraze/4060-55816/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55816\">Hatut Zeraze</a>. Hunter would do anything he could, no matter how violent, to appease King T’Chaka. Upon becoming king, T’Challa disbanded the Hatu Zeraze and Hunter decided to leave Wakanda, which is why he was in New York. T’Challa accepted Hunter’s offer of assistance and Hunter vowed absolute loyalty to him. However, T'Challa's acceptance was all a ruse. He did not trust Hunter, citing his excessively violent history, as the reason why. T’Challa later knocked him unconscious, regrouped with the others, and flew to Wakanda to face Achebe.</p><p>When he finally confronted Achebe at the Wakandan Palace, T'Challa allowed himself to be captured. He knew that Achebe would flee the country in fear, basically exiling himself, making him ruler again. When T’Challa escaped Achebe’s deathtrap, he was confronted by Hunter. The two engage in combat, which ended with T’Challa using a pinched never technique. They then flee the palace, going their separate ways, as Achebe’s explosive devices detonate.</p><h3>Marriage: Civil War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3208116\" data-ratio=\"1.0471204188482\" data-width=\"382\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 382px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3208116\"><img alt=\"The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg 382w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3208116-9425701671-62578.jpg 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" data-width=\"611\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Royal Couple; King T'Challa and Queen Ororo (Storm)</figcaption></figure><p>After teaming up with the X-Men a few times, T'Challa and <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ororo Munroe</a> (Storm) began dating.

As a result, the Wakandan-Skrull war began. T'Challa began to defend his nation with cunning tactics and technological marvels. Eventually, the two factions found themselves at a loss of technological weaponry. As a result, the two forces began to use old fashion and more primitive weaponry such as, the sword &amp; shield.

Not surprised that T'Challa refused to join their \"<a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a>\", Doom proceeded to attack him, pitting T'Challa and his Dora Milaje against him and his \"<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doombots/4060-59485/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59485\">doom-bots</a>\".</p><p>After a brutally epic battle, that resulted in T'Challa becoming gravely injured, the Dora Milaje and T'Challa fled Atlantis.

Elsewhere, Doom infiltrated Wakanda and managed to steal a large amount of processed vibranium.</p><p>He ventured to his home nation, Latveria, where he began attacking various cities around the world by using the vibranium to manipulate all vibranium-based objects and structures. Storm, Shuri, the Dora Milaje, and the Fantastic Four were instructed to take out Doom's worldwide network facilities, while T'Challa initiated a plan to save the world. The heroes later traveled to Latveria to confront Doom.</p><p>T'Challa engaged in combat with Doom and managed to plant a remote device on him that made processed vibranium inert.The device was so powerful that all vibranium across the world became defunct. Doom's newly acquired vibranium-based armor was rendered useless and he was defeated. T'Challa then returned to Wakanda to store some remaining active vibranium, that was recovered with the help of Storm, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.</p><h3>Black Panther: Most Dangerous Man Alive</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211914\"><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Panther: Man without Fear\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3211914-6752682040-21261.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Panther: Man without Fear</figcaption></figure><p>In order to defeat Doctor Doom, during the events of <a href=\"/doomwar/4045-56115/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56115\">Doomwar</a>, T'Challa was forced to destroy Wakanda's vibranium reserves by making the substance inert. He then relinquished his authority of Wakanda to the current Black Panther, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a>, as he left Wakanda to deal with his shame. He traveled to New York, where he reached an agreement with <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Matt Murdock</a> (Daredevil) to become the new protector of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hells-kitchen/4020-42295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42295\">Hell's Kitchen</a>.

Through this civilian identity, T'Challa sought to familiarize himself with the surrounding crime ridden area. Part of this new venture, was to relinquish every aspect of the Black Panther identity. He no longer had his Wakandan tech, superhuman senses, nor vibranium suit. He refused to return to Wakanda until he redeemed himself through this personal voyage of self discovery.</p><h3>King of the Dead</h3><p>After Daredevil returned to New York, T'Challa decided to move back to Wakanda. There, he began to have dreams, which he interpreted as premonitions. In his dreams he saw Bast, the Panther God and his long time friend, Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic). He reached out to Reed, offering him a summons to Wakanda, which he accepted. Once there, Reed assumed that he was there to talk about the vibranium reserves that T'Challa unwillingly had to make inert during the events of <a href=\"/doomwar/4045-56115/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56115\">Doomwar</a>. However, T'Challa assured him that his summoning of him was not about the vibranium.

She referred to him as \"King of the Dead\" and stated that he will have the strength and knowledge of every Wakandan king laid to rest in the Necropolis. She also vaguely predicted the events of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AvsX</a>.</p><h3>Avengers vs X-Men: Marriage Annulment</h3><p>During the events of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AvsX</a>, the powerful cosmic entity of death and rebirth, known as the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a>, returned to Earth and began seeking a host. A young teenager named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hope-summers/4005-49329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Hope </a>was suspected to be the Phoenix's targeted host. Because the young girl was a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/x-gene-mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a>, the X-Men want to offer her to the Phoenix, believing her to be the savior of the mutant race. However, the Avengers want to conceal the girl in fear that the Phoenix would corrupt her, making her a potential threat to mankind. The two factions then began to fight one another.</p><p>The Phoenix is incidentally divided into five energies by Iron Man, with each part taking a host, all of whom were X-Men. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> were bestowed and they began to reform the world to their will. Although some of their actions were generous and peaceful, the Avengers feared that such powerfully immense beings should not go unchecked. During the chaos that followed, T'Challa allied himself with the Avengers and Storm allied herself with the X-men. Many Wakandans were confused as to why their queen would ally herself with the X-Men and quickly declared her a traitor to the Wakandan Kingdom.</p><p>T'Challa provided a safe-house for the Avengers in Wakanda. In search of them, Namor attacked and almost sank Wakanda, killing hundreds if not thousands of its citizens. T'Challa was saddened and infuriated at the X-men as he declared them all enemies of his country. Storm later arrived in Wakanda and saw what Namor had done. She then approached T'Challa as he grieved for the lives that Namor had taken. Out of frustration at what had just happened, he scolded her. She attacked him (to his surprise) and the two began to fight. The Wakandans were shocked and confused as to why she would attack him and the High Priest of Wakanda annulled the marriage.</p><h3>The Illuminati</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211804-9388617086-27280.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211804\" data-ratio=\"1.517571884984\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3211804-9388617086-27280.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3211804\"><img alt=\"From left to right: Black Bolt, Iron Man, Black Panther, Dr. Strange, and Mr Fantastic.

Iron Man proposed that they form a government of superhumans similar to the United Nations that would meet regularly, in secret, to prevent an event like the Kree-Skrull War from happening again. After some debating, all except T'Challa agreed to form this \"<a href=\"../../illuminati/65-40421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illuminati</a>.\" T'Challa declined at the time, because he felt that the group would fail, due to them deciding that they were going to attempt to secretly govern the world.</p><p>Sometime later, after the events of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">AvsX</a>, T'Challa reconsidered joining the Illuminati after witnessing an event known as an \"Incursion\". An incursion is when two alternate universes collide into each other with alternate Earths as the epicenter. T'Challa encountered <a title=\"Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-TRN265)\" href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Yabbat_Ummon_Turru_(Earth-TRN265)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Swan</a>, a woman from an alternate Earth who had destroyed her own Earth to prevent it from colliding with Earth-616. T'Challa was on an expedition, in the jungles of Wakanda, with some potential candidates for Wakanda's space program, when she attacked them.</p><p>After Black Swan ordered her mercenaries to kill several of his candidates, T'Challa killed them and managed to capture her. He then contacted the Illuminati to report what he had just witnessed. Upon joining them, he swore to kill fellow Illuminati member, Namor, for attempting to sink Wakanda during the events of AvsX. The Illuminati and the Black Panther go on to deal with several more incursions, attempting to avoid doing what Black Swan had done, which was to destroy one alternate Earth to prevent it from colliding with another. However, the group finally realized that destroying the alternate Earths was their best option.</p><p>As time progressed, the hostilities between Wakanda and Atlantis increased. In an attempt to end the feud, Namor presented a peace offering to T'Challa for him to relay to his sister, Queen Shuri, the current ruler of Wakanda. T'Challa presented the peace offering to Queen Shuri, but she discarded it, citing that Namor's actions during AvsX was an act of terrorism. She then ordered an attack on Atlantis, while T'Challa distracted Namor with a fraudulent acceptance. The <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/hatut-zeraze/4060-55816/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55816\">Hatut Zeraze</a>, Wakanda's secret police, went on to decimate Atlantis.</p><p>The war conflict between the two men reached its breaking point during the Illuminati's battle with the <a href=\"/great-society/4060-60698/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60698\">Great Society</a>. T'Challa was poised to use an antimatter bomb to destroy the Society's world in order to save Earth-616, but refused to do so, as it would mean killing billions of innocent people. Namor then stole the detonator away and destroyed the planet anyway, claiming that he had the guts to do what T'Challa and the others would not. T'Challa savagely attacked Namor, but their confrontation was interrupted by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. Namor was expelled from the Illuminati for his actions, and left to form a new iteration of the <a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a>. For failing to destroy the Great Society's world (thus proving he does not have the will to defend Wakanda no matter what), the spirits of T'Chaka and the other past Black Panthers chastise T'Challa and shun him.</p><p>Eight months later, the Cabal had utterly decimated Wakanda. With the last survivors evacuated, T'Challa was given his father's ceremonial dagger by Shuri just before she was killed by <a href=\"/proxima-midnight/4005-90522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90522\">Proxima Midnight</a>. The fugitive members of the Illuminati later joined forces with the Avengers after Namor begged for help, explaining that the members of the Cabal (particularly <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>) had become too difficult to control. During the mission to trap the Cabal on an exploding world, T'Challa stabbed Namor and left him for dead. Unbeknownst to him, both Namor and the Cabal managed to survive.</p><h3>Secret Wars</h3><p>During the final incursion, Black Panther was one of the heroes that tried to stop Earth-1610 from destroying his Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's \"resurrection team\" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther was forced to put the \"lifeboat\" in action. As the \"lifeboat\" was deployed, Manifold teleported numerous heroes into it including Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Captain Marvel, Cyclops, and Thor, which allowed them to survive the end of the Multiverse.</p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes in the life raft would later be awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the Multiverse and the creation of <a href=\"/battleworld/4020-51065/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51065\">Battleworld</a>, a planet cobbled together from the fragments of destroyed realities ruled by Doom.</p><p>Black Panther and the other heroes were later transported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the Thor Corps, and after this Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life. Black Panther ended up in the domain of Egyptia along with Namor.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\" data-ratio=\"0.593\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6012801\"><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"With the Infinity Gauntlet\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/133942/6012801-4517478492-48842.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>With the Infinity Gauntlet</figcaption></figure><p>Three weeks later, while Battleworld was in dsarray, T'Challa, with Namor, arrived to Strange's Hidden Isle of Agamotto, using the Key of Agamotto given to them by Strange, they entered, and after identifying themselves as member of the Illuminati to a projection of the deceased Sorcerer Supreme, they were given access to some powerful items Strange had collected over the years, including the Siege Courageous and an Infinity Gauntlet that worked only in Doomstadt. Black Panther and Namor next traveled to the Deadlands for reinforcements, and Black Panther used his title as the King of the Dead to convince the zombies to join the forces opposing Doom. Using the Siege Courageous, the two of them arrived to the battlefield along with the zombies, proclaiming that Doom's reign is over.</p><p>Doom tried to convince T'Challa that he would rebuild Wakanda if he would stop fighting, but he refused the offer and struck Doom down.

Their battle ended when Doom crushed the Infinity Gauntlet and subdued T'Challa, but it was revealed to be a distraction, and Doom teleports to the <a href=\"/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man's </a>location.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250911\" data-ratio=\"0.73773987206823\" data-width=\"469\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 469px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.8%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250911\"><img alt=\"Escaping Battleworld\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png 469w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Escaping Battleworld\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png 469w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250911-black%20panther.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Escaping Battleworld</figcaption></figure><p>When the Molecule Man transferred his power to Mister Fantastic, Battleworld exploded. As the inhabitants of Battleworld were trying to run from their ultimate demise, Black Panther gripped tightly to the Reality Gem and was transported to his reborn native universe in the rebuilt Wakanda, to the time directly before the events of the incursions.</p><h3>The Ultimates</h3><p>T'Challa was approached by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a> about creating a problem solving team to deal with threats to Earth and the Universe on a cosmic scale. The team was formed consisting of Captain Marvel, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/blue-marvel/4005-57033/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57033\">Blue Marvel</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spectrum/4005-11337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Spectrum</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/ms-america/4005-78932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78932\">Ms America</a> and Black Panther. The first of their missions involved <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, T'Challa teleported himself into deep space to meet with Captain Marvel and Blue Marvel and open a dialogue with Galactus. T'Challa conversed with him explaining how he knew about the chamber which Galactus incubated himself in, and that it was still out in space containing unconsumed power. Along with the help of the Ultimates the team managed to get Galactus back into the chamber, which he then emerged out of reborn as Galactus the Lifebringer.</p><p>The next problem that the Ultimates sought to solve was the timestream which had been broken due to the abuse of time travel. They came to the conclusion that they cannot see the extent of the damage from within the Omniverse. T'Challa along with the help of Blue marvel developed a vehicle which can allow them to leave all that is known to view the timestream from outside the Omniverse. Travelling through the universe and different dimensions such as the Superflow and the Neutral Zone, they eventually manage to break out and leave the Omniverse. However, the vehicle they were in could not withstand the conditions exposing the Ultimates leaving them vulnerable, only to be saved by Galactus. T'Challa explained to him that they were there due to time being broken, to which Galactus responded sharing with them his own view of the time flow.</p><p>T'Challa and the Ultimates also played a role in Civil War II due to their use of the visions of Ulysses a new Inhuman that supposedly predicted the future. The Ultimates acted on these visions trying to stop problems before they happened. Most notably T'Challa was present on the mission to stop the attack by Thanos predicted by Ulysses. They succeeded in capturing Thanos but at the cost of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/war-machine/4005-1926/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1926\">War Machine</a> who was killed in the battle. Thanos also subsequently escaped his holding cell but T'Challa and Blue Marvel managed to stop him again using their intellect to create a device to shut down Thanos' brain temporarily.</p><p>Eventually the Ultimates were disbanded due to T'Challa's actions in Civil War II where he publicly disagreed with Captain Marvels actions, claiming she had gone too far and an attack on him meant an attack on Wakanda. The American government could not continue with the Ultimates operations due to the political move by T'Challa leading to the disbanding of the Ultimates.</p><h3>A Nation Under Our Feet</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\" data-ratio=\"0.64819944598338\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.8%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5250922\"><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png 361w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Providing a glimpse into his true power\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png 361w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126675/5250922-black%20panther%201.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Providing a glimpse into his true power</figcaption></figure><p>8 months after the events of Secret Wars, Black Panther returned to his home in Wakanda as the king. After facing threats of cosmic levels, he finally sought to return to a normal life. His wish was not fulfilled when he returned to a revolution against the idea of his monarchy led by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zenzi/4005-127863/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi</a>. At this time he is also coping with the seeming death of his sister, Shuri. With all of his pent up rage, he finally learned to release and revealed that for his entire life he was holding back. He vowed to demonstrate his true power from that moment forwards.</p><p>His rule however, was contested by opposition groups who believed he was not fit to rule and that he did not protect Wakanda from the threats it had faced. Two of the greatest Dora Milaje, the midnight warriors Aneka and Ayo opposed T'Challa and left the Dora Milaje to oppose his rule with the key phrase 'no one man'. They had found their own followers building up a community of people who wanted to leave the kings rule and took over the Jabari-Lands. Another group that opposed T'challa was called 'the people' lead by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tetu/4005-129745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-129745\">Tetu</a> a former student of the Wakandan philosopher <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/changamire/4005-132088/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-132088\">Changamire</a> who's teachings were used as the war drum for the rebels and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zenzi/4005-127863/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127863\">Zenzi</a> who were the leaders of the rebels.</p><p>Tetu and Zenzi had amassed a fairly large amount of followers and even turned some into living bombs using repulsor technology one of which had detonated in the heart of Wakanda injuring Ramonda T'challa's mother. T'challa even recruited some of his friends from outside Wakanda to help him fight the rebels such as <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"/storm/4050-7191/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-7191\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/manifold/4005-62072/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62072\">Manifold</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/misty-knight/4005-1491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1491\">Misty Knight</a>. He even went to further lengths organising a counterrevolution council of dictators who had experience in dealing with revolution. However, he was betrayed and the evidence of this meeting with highly questionable characters got to the people of Wakanda which hurt the King's standing with the people even though he rejected all suggestions. While all this was going on T'challa was also working on bringing his sister <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a> back from the living death she was entrapped in during <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a>'s invasion of Wakanda. He managed to succeed in doing this using the help of Manifold and returned Shuri back to life, though she now had supernatural powers.</p><p>With Shuri's help and the Changamire's speech to the people, support for T'challa and the government was back and he began to devise a way to defeat the rebels once and for all. Tetu and Zenzi amassed their forces for a final assault on the centre of Wakanda the forces held them off for a while with the help of Shuri and Manifold. Eventually the forces did break through to the city, but T'challa had lead Tetu and his forces to him. He had earlier gone to the necropolis the city of the dead to raise the past leaders of Wakanda to fight one last time. With their help T'challa managed to defeat the rebels and Tetu ending the rebellion. After the problem of the rebels had been extinguished T'challa called together leaders from each of the regions to aide him in forming a new government that was representative of all the people's needs while still keeping the traditions of Wakandan culture.</p><h2>Powers</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3210997\" data-ratio=\"1.275\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3210997\"><img alt=\"T'Challa, demonstrating his superhuman reflexes.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png 501w\"><noscript><img alt=\"T'Challa, demonstrating his superhuman reflexes.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111112802/3210997-4905926307-T%2527C.png 501w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" data-width=\"501\"></noscript></a><figcaption>T'Challa, demonstrating his superhuman reflexes.</figcaption></figure><p>Upon becoming chief of the Panther Clan and king of Wakanda, T'Challa was entitled to eat the ceremonial Wakandan <a href=\"/heart-shaped-herb/4055-43809/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43809\">Heart-shaped Herb</a>, which provided him with enhanced strength, endurance, and reflexes.

He de-powers Storm with a special necklace and kills T'Challa's family. T'Challa challenges Erik, but is killed by him. Storm eventually kills Erik herself and then reveals that T'Challa's death was a plot by Storm to look heroic to the Wakandan people.</p><h3>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)</h3><p>In the alternate reality called Age of Apocalypse, T'Challa is the last king of Wakanda and he is loved and worshiped by his people.

Giant Man asks T'Challa to take him back to his lab when he notices that Hank had been bitten by a zombie. He questions Hank about the bite and he attacks him and he falls unconscious. He awakes and realises that his right arm and leg is missing and that Giant Man is keeping him prisoner as a source of food. With the help of Wasp, whose head remained animated, he eventually escapes the lab.</p><p>After making a crutch and tucking Wasp's head under his arm he makes his way through the ruins of the city and is confronted by the Acolytes, who mistake him for a zombie. After a failed attack, Black Panther joins forces with them and they aboard Asteroid M. While there he meets Forge and he helps build a cybernetic arm and leg for him. While here he also meets Lisa Hendricks who he later marries and has a son with.</p><p>Five years later, the Acolytes land Asteroid M in the middle of New York after a scan detected no movement on the planet. Black Panther, along with his wife and child, step into the world. Wasp comes with them, her hunger being replenished. It is around this time that T'Challa receives a call from a Black Panther from another reality who is having problems with zombified super-heroes on the Skrull home-world.</p><p>Forty years later, New York is now renamed Wakanda and T'Challa is now king. However, there is no reliable way to restore the population that once lived in the city. Frustrated with this, the Acolytes come up with a plan to remove T'Challa from the throne and hire an assassin the sneak into the Royal Palace. The assassin manages to stab T'Challa in the chest, and alerted by the intrusion, Wasp (now in her cybernetic body) attacks the assassin. T'Challa is critically injured and the only way he can survive is if he becomes a zombie, so Wasp bites him. With her hunger returning, Wasp tries to eat Lisa but is stopped by T'Challa and he joins her in eating the assassin instead.</p><p>A few weeks later, Reynolds, Hawkeye and Forge release T'Challa due to the leader of the Acolytes trying to kill them. However, they get caught and pre-occupied with the arrival of the Zombie Galacti. After fighting and defeating the zombies with the help of Spider-Man and Luke Cage who are cured of their hunger, they retreat to a new Wakanda and seal the zombies out of the palace by using a force field to keep them out. However, Gladiator and Bruce Banner are trapped inside as well and Gladiator dies when he attacks T'Challa. T'Challa and the others realise they are not well-mannered enough to protect the portal that the zombies come through and Reynolds reveals that T'Challa's dead son T'Channa is dressed as Colonel America and that Reynolds and Forge have planted Colonel America's brain in his son's body. T'Channa attacks his father but is then reminded of who he is.</p><p>The zombies then return and release the force field and T'Challa and the group defeat them, but Iron Man manages to get through. After Banner deactivates the force field, the zombies get through to the survivors, but realise they are not hungry. However, during the fight before, T'Challa gets smashed, which left him with only with his arm, leg, chest, neck and head attached and Wasp crushed from the waist up. After the zombies cope with their newly found humanity, the Hulk breaks into the room, eats Reynolds and kills Iron Man, Phoenix, Firelord and Hawkeye before being stopped by Spider-Man, Giant Man and Wolverine.</p><p>After getting a new body by Forge, the zombies help the survivors get supplies and breed in other dimensions. However, Malcolm Cortez, the leader of the Acolytes reveals he was behind the assassination attempt on T'Challa, T'Channa's death and a plot to kill K'Shamba, Panther's grandson. He says he likes this way of life and wants to get rid of the zombie plague and sends T'Challa to another dimension. T'Challa arrives on the reality Earth-Z on the Skrull home world where he converts the entire species and leads his own horde against this Earth's Avengers where he is slain and his arm mounted on the Avenger Tower as a trophy.</p><h3>Legacy Virus Merged With Warlock (Earth-8545)</h3><p>T'Challa is the son of T'Chaka, late king of the African nation Wakanda. When lawless ivory hunter Ulysses Klaw murdered T'Chaka in an attempt to possess the country's rare Vibranium deposit, a grief-stricken T'Challa swore vengeance and succeeded in thwarting the butcher's raid. In the process, the young prince destroyed Klaw's hand. T'Challa returned to his homeland after recieving a degree in physics ready to assume the mantle of leadership. To do so, he needed to defeat six of Wakanda's greatest warriors in unarmed combat, and obtain the secret heart-shaped herb that grants the country's chieftains their powers. Successfully carrying out the dual challenge, T'Challa donned the ceremonial garb of the Black Panther, totem of the Wakandan people. Under T'Challa, Wakanda has become one of the wealthiest and technologically advanced nations on the planet. After meeting Captain America, the Panther was offered membership in the Avengers.</p><h3>Ruins (Earth-9591)</h3><p>He is known as T'Challa des Wakandas and is a member of the Black Panther Party imprisoned alongside Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in San Francisco.</p><h3>Wonder-Man Saved The Avengers ( Earth-9916)</h3><p>T'Challa joins the Avenges some time after Quicksilver departs and fights alongside his teammates against Quicksilver, who used a Grim Reaper disguise to hide his true identity. After his defeat, he is unmasked by an astonished Scarlet Witch. In a battle between the Avengers and Magneto, Quicksilver dies when Magneto tries to kill Scarlet Witch. Scarlet Witch eventually kills Magneto with a powerful hex bolt. Black Panther is present at the wedding of Scarlet Witch and Wonder-Man.</p><p>The Black Panther joined the Avengers some time after Quicksilver left. He fought alongside his teammates against Quicksilver, who used the disguise of the Grim Reaper in order to conceal his true identity. After his defeat, Pietro was unmasked to the shock of his sister.</p><p>In a subsequent battle between the Avengers and Magneto’s forces, Quicksilver was killed in his sister's stead when Magneto tried to kill Wanda for being a traitor to mutantkind. Overcome by grief, Wanda unleashed a powerful hex which killed Magneto. Black Panther was later present at Wonder Man and the Scarlet Witch's wedding. During the Vision's assault on the Avengers, Black Panther fought against him alongside his teammates.</p><h3>Earth X - (Earth-9997)</h3><p>The history of the Black Panther in this reality is similar to that of the Panther in the 616 mainstream. However, in this reality, the heart shaped herbs that granted him his powers also grant them to anyone else who takes them. Due to the nature of his mutation, however, T'Challa's powers are partially subconscious. In the recent history of this reality, Captain America gives T'Challa the Cosmic Cube of Safe Keepings as he believes that Panther would not use the device or give it to anyone else. During this time, he marries Storm and humanity begins to mutate due to the Terrigen Mists in the Earth's atmosphere. Due to this, T'Challa has more of a panther appearance while the animals in Wakanda which were part of a wildlife reserve that Panther set up, began to mutate as well becoming humanoid creatures known as Ani-Men. When the Skrull begin to take over the United States, Captain America asks T'Challa to give him the Cosmic Cube. Out of respect for his friend, he denies his friend's request and does not involve himself in the final battle against the Skrulls. After the death of the celestial embryo in the Earth's core, the axis shift of the Earth turns Africa into a frozen wasteland, but thanks to Beast's technology, Wakanda maintains its tropical ecosystem and keeps out most threats.</p><p>When Mar-vel comes to Wakanda in search of the Cosmetic Cube to destroy Death, T'Challa refuses to give him the Cube. It isn't until Storm is killed by a Wendigo attack and suddenly brought back to life that Mar-vel reveals that the Cube is responsible for that and the mutation of the Ani-Men because it was acting on Panther's wants. This revelation mortifies Panther and he hands the Cube over to Mar-vel who leaves to help the Wakandans relocate to the Savage Land so that they can escape the frequent Wendigo attacks that keep occurring. On the way to the Savage Land, Black Panther is followed by the Wendigo. He defeats them and discovers that they are really the Multiple Man in disguise. T'Challa and Storm help build a new Wakandan nation in the Savage Land with the help of everyone who travels with them. They are attacked by Belasco and the Dire Wraiths but are quickly saved by Mar-vel and his friends. A few months later, T'Challa accompanies Storm to the wedding of Medusa and King Britain, where they meet Bloodstorm. She asks Storm to perform a blood transfusion to cure her of her vampirism. Storm agrees to the procedure and it is unknown what happens to Black Panther went after this point.</p><h3>Marvel Mangaverse (Earth- 2301)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\" data-ratio=\"1.4472843450479\" data-width=\"626\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 626px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637720\"><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth-2301 Mangaverse\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 626w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15776/637720-blackpanther1.jpg 442w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Earth-2301 Mangaverse</figcaption></figure><p>In the<a href=\"/marvel-mangaverse/4015-46090/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46090\"> Marvel Mangaverse</a>, T’Challa is still King of Wakanda and when calling upon the help of the God Qamatha, he can transform into a Were-Panther.

In this form, his appearance is heavily influenced by the ancient Egyptian god Horus. In this reality, his magical abilities are prominent as Dr. Strange notices his magical trail.</p><h3>Stand-off with Doom (Earth-10267)</h3><p>On Earth-10267, after a standoff with Dr. Doom, Black Panther and Namor the Submariner become bitter enemies. War eventually breaks out between Wakanda and Atlantis when Namor floods the Capital City of Wakanda and causes it to overgrow with vegetation making it nearly uninhabitable. In retaliation, Black Panther sends \"Panther Tanks\" to Atlantis and destroys Namor's throne room. This leads to Namor unleashing an endless horde of sea-beasts upon the now-flooded Wakandan Capital, which in turn lead to more retaliatory strikes from Black Panther. The war continues until both Wakanda and Atlantis are laid to waste and left in total ruins.</p><h3>Wild West</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6607551\" data-ratio=\"1.6014388489209\" data-width=\"695\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 695px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6607551\"><img alt=\"The King\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 695w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 599w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 399w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The King\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 695w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 599w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6607551-cowboy%20panther.jpg 399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The King</figcaption></figure><p>In an Old West version of the Marvel Universe, T'Challa is once again the young son of King T'Chaka.

After Surtur was defeated, Bor abdicated his throne to Odin, making Odin the new ruler of <a href=\"../../asgard-marvel/34-40990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asgard</a>.

Thor grew to become a mighty warrior and defeated countless trolls, giants and extra-dimensional beings, enemies of Asgard all, but in doing so became quite arrogant and conceited. Odin, displeased with Thor's distinct lack of humility, exiled Thor from Asgard while making him appear mortal and depowered.

The only clue as to who is threatening them, is the word infinity which continues echoing through Odin’s mind.</p><p>Thor is left with the task of defending Asgard from oncoming threats as Odin leaves Asgard for the world beyond, where he will face the unseen terror. When Loki later attacks Asgard with the giants, Odin once more appears in a cloud of smoke and is seen struggling with an unseen force. This prompts Thor to leave for the world Beyond and face Infinity himself. In the world beyond Odin is still battling the hidden foe and eventually sees his enemy’s face before succumbing and being possessed.</p><p>After witnessing Odin’s loss of free will and seeking out Hel, Thor travels back to Asgard and reveals the truth about Infinity. During the last <a href=\"/odinsleep/4015-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55777\">Odinsleep</a> Hel attempted to kill Odin with a spell, instead the spell set loose a part of Odin’s soul and created an equal power which she could control. The Asgardians gather and are able to strike a blow which combines magical and physical forces to free him from the mind-control. After a long and grueling battle Odin is eventually victorious and saves the universe.</p><h3>Odin Against the Celestials</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659339\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.2958801498127\" data-width=\"267\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 267px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:229.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-659339\"><img alt=\"Odin animating the Destroyer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg 267w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Odin animating the Destroyer\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/659339-attack_2.jpg 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px\" data-width=\"267\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Odin animating the Destroyer</figcaption></figure><p>Odin is once killed by <a href=\"/\">Mangog</a> and is resurrected by the Death goddess <a href=\"/\">Hela</a>.

Surtur fatally wounds Odin and is about to die. Odin's tremendous powers began to drift away from Odin to his son Thor. Thor inherited Odin's full power and ruled over Asgard and, later, Earth, although this later part of Thor's lordship has been erased due to time travel. Upon his return to the past the Odin-Force (revealed to be sentient) leaves Thor and he is forced to continue without it. Loki set's Ragnarok in motion, and after the loss of his hammer Thor feels almost powerless to stop it. After conferring with the Odin-Power Thor follows in the footsteps of his father, going through rituals to earn the rights to his power, and power of his own. This brought him even closer to his father, and helped him to understand his father's plans for him. Odin's spirit was called on by Thor to protect him from Hela, and he brought his son back from the realm of the Dead. Thor then went on to use the Odin-Power and his new found Rune Magic to destroy the Loom of fate and allow their people a final Ragnarok. The event of Ragnarok was thought to mark the end of Odin.</p><p>After using his powers to restore the people of Asgard after Ragnarok, Thor was forced to partake of the Odin-Sleep. While in the realm between life and death he found his father in combat with Surtur. He fights a continuous battle to keep Surtur from escaping and again threatening Asgard and Midgard. When Thor expresses his joy at seeing him, and apologizes for not resurrecting him, Odin relates the story of how he came to be King to his son. Odin goes on to explain that while men need only step out of their father's shadow, God's truly need their father's to die before they can surpass them. He expresses his pride that Thor is willing to revive him, but declines to continue keeping Surtur at bay.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Return</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409956\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4344444444444\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1409956\"><img alt=\"The Return of Odin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 669w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Return of Odin\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 669w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1409956-114_thor_618.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Return of Odin</figcaption></figure><p>During the <i>Siege</i> storyline, Norman Osborn sends the Thunderbolts to steal Odin's spear from the Asgardian weaponry.

Odin returns from the dead when it comes to Asgard being invaded by the World-Eaters after Thor is forced to break his final resting casket in order to do so. Odin's return angers him greatly, as well as Thor rescuing Loki, who was de-aged after his \"death\" at the hands of the Void during the Siege. Saying that Thor had it all, free of his brother tricks and free to reign with his brother, Balder but he gave it all up because of the World-Eaters because he was \"afraid\" to do it himself.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><p>After Odin had slain the evil giant <a href=\"/laufey/4005-31821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31821\">Laufey</a>, he found Laufey's young son.

These include stopping Loki, the Storm, Surtur and several other villains who attempted to destroy Earth many different times by numerous means.</p><p>Odin has also rescued Asgard. His most notable victory is that he saved Asgard from being absorbed by the <a href=\"/absorbing-man/4005-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\">Absorbing Man</a>. At that time, Loki wanted the Asgard throne and teamed up with the newly recreated Absorbing Man. The Absorbing Man defeats all of the Asgardian guards and makes his way to Odin's throne room. Odin uses his magical powers to defeat the Absorbing Man but instead the magical energy had been absorbed into the Absorbing Man. The Absorbing Man then touches Asgardian matter and begins to absorb the entire city. Eventually Loki and the Absorbing Man tries to take Odin's political powers by getting the Rod of Rulership. However, Odin has tricked them into arguing with each other and both of them grab the Rod of Rulership and finds out that Odin had placed a binding spell on the Rod of Rulership. The two villains couldn't separate themselves from the Rod of Rulership. Odin tells them that his political powers and magical powers were from within and not from the Rod of Rulership. Odin then uses a powerful magical spell and exiles both villains into space for a period of time.</p><p>Odin tries to save Asgard by sacrificing his right eye to <a href=\"/mimir/4005-34944/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34944\">Mimir</a> in order to save Asgard from the fate of Ragnarok. However, Odin fails to prevent Ragnarok from happening and later learns that Thor is one of the major beings who caused the fall of Asgard.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Though not omnipotent, Odin is a vastly powerful being who has lived hundreds of thousands of years ( possible millions ) and reaped the benefits in knowledge and power.</p><h3>Odin Force</h3><p>Odin has access to a force known as the Odin force. This lets him manipulate vast cosmic energy power. This power grants him spectacular feats, For example he has been shown to read minds from across dimensions, create force field barriers that are nearly impossible to get through, alter his size, Force blasts strong enough to one shot silver surfer. The Odin force grants him the power to enchant items like Mjolnir.</p><p>Odin is highly talented and practiced with this Odin force; He has been able to bring back people from the dead, fight Thanos and even Galactus. At his peak strength with the Odin force, he was able to attack Galactus (a hungry Galactus) and make him unconscious for a short time before entering the Odin sleep to replenish his energy. The Odin force also grants him the power to give immortality. Odin has shown to be able to create and destroy a galaxy, teleport Asgard to Earth, project energy blasts powerful enough to demolish worlds, make a world collapse on an enemy flying to him from space, stop time and space, and much more.</p><h3>Invulnerability/Durability</h3><p>Odin is highly resistant to nearly all forms of superhuman levels of attack. If injured, the nearly limitless mystical power of the Odin Force which flows through his veins will fix the damage instantly. He has been shown to not be affected by attacks from Silver Surfer for example, demonstrating his durability. He can withstand powerful energy attacks from cosmic-level entities unphased, though to what extent is unknown.</p><h3>Teleportation</h3><p>Odin can teleport himself and others to any location he desires, even to alternate dimensions, he proved capable of teleporting Asgard over New York City just to show how powerful he was(and that he was capable of dimensional transportation).</p><h3>Energy Manipulation</h3><p>Odin can manipulate all forms of energy(light, heat,etc.) for a variety of affects. He has proven capable of manipulating mystical energies as well.</p><h3>Time Manipulation</h3><p>Odin has proven capable of being able to stop time itself, reverse time, and even create time bubbles of which prevent outside interference.</p><h3>Matter Manipulation</h3><p>Odin feats include transmuting the elements themselves, creating new worlds out of nothing, rekindling dead stars(such as turning a dying red sun into a vibrant blue star), effortlessly destroying entire galaxies, and even repairing damage that had occurred to large portions of the universe.</p><h3>Barriers/Force Fields</h3><p>Odin has created force fields that are completely impenetrable and can shield entire cities from nuclear blasts without cracking.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>Other abilities include reading minds across dimensions, mastering countless powerful spells(mainly Asgardian in nature). An example of this is how Odin put the worthiness enchantment on <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">mjolnir</a>. The enchantment is so powerful that it will always remain on mjolnir(even if Odin dies), and can only be removed by Odin's will or by a being of superior power.</p><h3>Superhuman strength/speed</h3><p>Odin is one of the oldest Asgardians, despite this he has been shown to lift over 60 tons (the average is 30 tons for a male), His highest feat in old age during the time of the celestials 3rd host on earth he was shown to be able to lift 75-90 Tons. But he could also lift heavier with his powers but these are just his natural strength feats. He has also been shown to be able to move faster than earths best human athletes.</p><h3>Superhuman Stamina</h3><p>Odin was able to battle against an army of his brother, Cul's gods for forty days and forty nights without tiring.</p><h3>Agility and reflexes</h3><p>Odin has been shown to have better agility than human athletes, his reflexes also rival Thor (This could be down to the Odin force)</p><h2><b>Weaknesses</b></h2><p>To sustain his Odin force he has to Odinsleep once a year. This is when he deep sleeps for up to or over a week and becomes mortal in this time, so he is very vulnerable. He has claimed that “love” is a weakness for him; he has been blinded by it and not made the correct choices before.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'9\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 650 lbs.</li><li><b>Eyes</b>: Blue</li><li><b>Hair</b>: White</li></ul><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Over his eons of existence Odin has wielded many weapons in battle, from simple swords to bo staffs. In earlier incarnations, Odin was never without his sceptre (A weapon through which he channeled the Odinforce). His vast power usually makes it unnecessary for him to resort to common fisticuffs, but he does have two special weapons that he will utilize under the most dire circumstances. His enchanted spear <a href=\"/gungnir/4055-47219/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47219\">Gungnir</a>, and his powerful mace Thrudstok. At times he will also don a mystical sword, as he did in latest battle with Surtur. In addition to weapons, he has a chest filled with magical trinkets and amulets for various purposes. Among these there is an amulet of suns which is capable of directly countering the cask of never ending winters.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6663840\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6663840\"><img alt=\"Avengers: EMH\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Avengers: EMH\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6663840-odin%20emh.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Avengers: EMH</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Odin appears in<a href=\"/the-marvel-super-heroes/4075-322/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-322\"><em> The Marvel Super Heroes</em></a>, voiced by Bernard Cowen.</li><li>Odin appears in <a href=\"/the-super-hero-squad-show/4075-158/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-158\"><em>The Super Hero Squad Show</em></a>, voiced by Jess Harnell.</li><li>Odin appears in <a href=\"/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/4075-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-18\"><em>The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em></a>, voiced by Clancy Brown.</li><li>Odin appears in <a href=\"/avengers-assemble/4075-19/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-19\"><em>Avengers Assemble</em></a>, voiced by Frank Welker.</li><li>Odin appears in<a href=\"/hulk-and-the-agents-of-s-m-a-s-h/4075-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-34\"><em> Hulk and the</em> <em>Agents of S.M.A.S.H.</em></a>, with Frank Welker reprising his role.</li><li>Odin appears in the <a href=\"/ultimate-spiderman/4075-13/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-13\"><em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em></a> episode \"Field Trip,\" where he has entered the Odinsleep.</li><li>Odin appears in <a href=\"/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy/4075-575/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-575\"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a>, voiced again by Frank Welker.</li><li>Odin appears in<em> Marvel Future Avengers</em>, voiced by Bin Sasaki in the Japanese version and <a href=\"/fred-tatasciore/4040-73530/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-73530\">Fred Tatasciore</a> in the English dub.</li></ul><h3>Film</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742743\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1555555555556\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1742743\"><img alt=\"Sir Anthony Hopkins as Odin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg 360w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sir Anthony Hopkins as Odin\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47226/1742743-thor10.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sir Anthony Hopkins as Odin</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Odin is featured in <a href=\"/ultimate-avengers-2/4025-151/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-151\"><em>Ultimate Avengers 2</em></a> (though he does not appear physically), voiced by Dwight Schultz.</li><li>Odin appears in<a href=\"/hulk-vs-thor/4025-187/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-187\"><em> Hulk vs. Thor</em></a>, voiced by French Tickner.</li><li>Odin appears in <a href=\"/thor-tales-of-asgard/4025-1242/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1242\"><em>Thor: Tales of Asgard</em></a>, voiced by Christopher Britton.</li><li>Odin appears in the 2011 live action film, <a href=\"/thor/4025-949/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-949\"><i>Thor</i></a>.

As a young man, Brock Rumlow was the leader of a small New York gang. There he encountered a young <a href=\"/diamondback/4005-25689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25689\">Diamondback</a>, she wanted to join his gang and he used his size to overpower her and rape her. When she came home her two brothers saw what happened to her and went after Brock for revenge. One of the brothers was killed by Crossbones with a throwing knife and the other left the family in shame to eventually become the mercenary <a href=\"/cutthroat/4005-3236/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3236\">Cutthroat</a>.</p><p>As he grew and became more a part of the criminal underworld he began learning about the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> and looked up to him as a god-like figure. After joining <a href=\"/taskmaster/4005-4578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\">Taskmaster</a>'s school for criminals, Crossbones worked his way up the ladder and quickly became a teacher. While observing some of his fights, the Red Skull instructed Taskmaster to bring Brock to him. Sometime later he began working for <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-77248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77248\">Albert Malik</a>, the man who was claiming to be the Red Skull. He was hired to take a team of mercenaries and break into a castle belonging to the actual Skull. After avoiding defenses and showing some skill with a bow and arrow, a blob-like monster proved to be the ultimate threat. All but one other mercenary was killed and they were taken prisoner by the Skull and <a href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\">Arnim Zola</a>. Brock was interrogated by the Skull and he revealed who his employer was and his dedication to the Red Skull. Rather than kill him, the Skull challenges Brock to a fight in order to test his new body that had been cloned from <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a>. Exhausted from scaling the mountain to get to the castle, Brock is beaten but the Skull sees the evil in him and offers him training and a spot as his new bodyguard. He also gives him his new name, Crossbones.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Crossbones was created by Mark Gruenwald and Kieron Dwyer and first appeared in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/captain-america-359-wheel-of-death/4000-31759/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-31759\">Captain America #359</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Skull's Assassin</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72893/1458791-crossbones_h07b.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72893/1458791-crossbones_h07b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/72893/1458791-crossbones_h07b.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Years later, Brock has become one of the world's greatest killers and is working for the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> as the leader of <a href=\"/skeleton-crew/4060-44134/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44134\">the Skeleton Crew</a> and his most loyal follower. After the Skull is kidnapped and tortured by <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> during <a href=\"/acts-of-vengeance/4045-41931/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41931\">Acts of Vengeance</a>, Crossbones leads the assault on the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>'s New York building to break him out. Once inside, <a href=\"/machinesmith/4005-28676/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28676\">Machinesmith</a> hacks into their cameras and tells them that their leader isn't there. Crossbones then forces a weak psychic to track down the Skull. They find him near death in an abandoned bomb shelter hidden in a cemetery. He asks to be taken to Skull House and - despite protests from the rest of the Skeleton Crew - Crossbones takes him there. Crossbones sees his boss' condition as the result of Magneto destroying his killer instinct and he tries to help his boss by reminding him of all the people he has killed but it doesn't work. The Skull then asks him to summon his greatest enemy, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, to Skull House. Upon seeing the face of everything he hates, the Skull regains his will to live so that he can kill Cap.</p><p>While recuperating, the Red Skull waged a war against the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>. Crossbones was sent to kill the <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> villain. Crossbones attacks him in a restaurant but Daredevil interferes. Crossbones defeats him (and the hero is left pinned under a table), but during this, the Kingpin escapes. <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a> then attempts to kill the Red Skull and battles Crossbones. Lester kills a robot of the Red Skull and the two fight in the room. Bullseye says he is impressed by Crossbones' speed, and Crossbones quickly closes the gap between the two and punches him once, knocking the assassin over. Crossbones then begins to choke him, saying he could kill him in a second, but he deserves to suffer. Bullseye then spits a fake tooth in his eye and stabs his bicep, then flees the building.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2119335-letter_6.jpeg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2119335-letter_6.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2119335-letter_6.jpeg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2119335-letter_6.jpeg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The Skull is kidnapped by <a href=\"/hauptmann-deutschland/4005-28054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28054\">Captain Germany</a> and put on trial for his crimes as a leader of the Nazi party. Crossbones then leads the Skeleton Crew in an attempt to take him back but they are defeated by Germany's team of super soldiers and are put on trial with the Skull. Arnim Zola breaks them out using his genetically-altered soldiers to pose as the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. After they were returned to the Smith Building, the Skull had all of the Skeleton Crew fake their deaths so that they could go into hiding and they could continue their business without government surveillance. The Red Skull decides to add fresh blood to his criminal organization and orders Crossbones to break <a href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\">Viper</a> out of prison. Crossbones then voices his disapproval and is immediately fired for insubordination. In an attempt to get back in the Skull's good favor, he kidnaps Cap's girlfriend, Diamondback, and attempts to brainwash her into betraying him. He appears to succeed and she even steals a sample of Cap's blood from <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/4020-41036/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41036\">Avengers Mansion</a> for him, but after he regains entry into the Skull's lair, he returns to the <a href=\"/skeleton-crew/4060-44134/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44134\">Skeleton Crew</a> and Cutthroat begins to fear that he will be replaced by him and tries to kill him in his sleep. Unfortunately for Cutthroat, Crossbones was told of the plan by <a href=\"/mother-night/4005-28055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28055\">Mother Night</a>, and he kills Cuttroat first (by slitting his throat), causing Diamondback to reveal that her apparent brainwashing is just an act and she tries to kill him in retaliation as Cap storms the Skull's fortress. They narrowly escape the destruction of the base and Crossbones is injured when an explosion sends shrapnel into his back.</p><h3>The Death of Captain America</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175476-167107-crossbones.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175476-167107-crossbones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175476-167107-crossbones.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175476-167107-crossbones.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Crossbones was the sniper who shot Steve Rogers after the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War</a>.

The most recent incarnation of the <a href=\"/serpent-squad/4060-45923/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45923\">Serpent Squad</a> led by his girlfriend <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\">Sin</a> was sent to rescue him.

Crossbones battled the <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">new Captain America</a>, and threw him out a window. Captain America was saved by <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> and shot Crossbones several times in the chest. In prison, he sat patiently and waited for some sign from the Red Skull until he heard a guard mention that they also had Sin in custody. Crossbones then killed a guard and went on a rampage searching for her. After knocking out multiple guards, he found her in the hospital and manages to kiss her before being gassed and returned to his cell. <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> has recently released Crossbones, saying in exchange he needs to work for him.</p><h3>As a Thunderbolt</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111230/3558957-crossbones.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111230/3558957-crossbones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111230/3558957-crossbones.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111111230/3558957-crossbones.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>When the <a href=\"/the-heroic-age/4045-56023/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56023\">Heroic Age</a> came, Crossbones found himself on the Raft.

The reason he is on the team is because Crossbones is generally an unlikable person, so if any of the inmate Thunderbolt members disagree with Cage, they might think twice because they'll be siding with Crossbones. Crossbones is also not permitted to have lethal rounds of ammunition on him, so he's carrying around tranquilizers and hard rounds only. He has currently completed the <a href=\"/troll/4005-72910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72910\">Troll</a> mission, where he shot a human girl dressed up as a troll, and is the cave mission, where he equipped a mini-gun and flamethrower to defeat these mutant monsters.</p><p>When Crossbones and the other members were sent to New Guinea to investigate a deposit of <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\">Terringen Crystals</a>, Crossbones was exposed to its radioactive mist. During the unsanctioned mission to rescue Darris Kimbro from the Hands underground fortress under Hell's Kitchen, it seems that Crossbones has developed powers as a consequence to his exposure of the radioactive mist from the Terringen Crystals. With his new-found powers of generating fire from his mask, he wiped out a whole squad of <a href=\"/the-hand/4060-1800/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-1800\">Hand</a> ninjas, but also killed Darris Kimbro in the process. He was recently dropped from the team after an escape attempt was foiled by Steve Rogers, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, and Luke Cage. During the encounter, Crossbones had a brutal fight with Rogers, taking the edge and besting him with his new-found powers and hand-to-hand abilities. When Captain America was down, they were standing near water which revealed a reflection of who they want to be. Crossbones was shocked by seeing a reflection of the Red Skull, and the hero took advantage of the moment, defeating his foe. Later on, during the events of <i>Fear Itself</i>, Crossbones was able to escape The Raft and killing the man who helped him out.</p><h3>Working for the Man</h3><p>During his time in custody, Crossbones was sent to an isolated island that was hit by a terrible virus outbreak. Brock was sent in with one objective: rescue the one person who may possess the resistance to the virus. Heavily armed, Brock eventually meets a camp of survivors on the island. It turns out the individual is just a boy, and Brock betrays the survivors by letting the monsters (who are essentially werewolves) into their base. Brock battles a few, snapping their necks and withstanding a handful of claw attacks before reaching his evacuation helicopter with the child. But, Brock betrays his employers by pushing the boy out of the helicopter, sending him falling to his death.</p><h3>The Fearless</h3><p>After the events of <i>Fear Itself</i>, Sin is now in search of the missing hammers and other mystical weapons. As her lover and right-hand man, Crossbones is now globe-trotting to find these items. This journey has taken him to France, underwater, face-to-face with <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, and, most recently, he took down Luke Cage while wearing one of the gauntlets he retrieved. Previews reveal this former Captain America foe will soon face-off with famous X-Man, <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3><a href=\"/heroes-reborn/4045-55955/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55955\">Heroes Reborn</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175479\" data-ratio=\"1.1275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:112.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175479\"><img alt=\"Heroes Reborn Crossbones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" data-width=\"567\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heroes Reborn Crossbones\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/175479-36666-crossbones.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" data-width=\"567\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heroes Reborn Crossbones</figcaption></figure><p>In the Heroes Reborn universe, Crossbones was a large, hulking thug who worked as the Red Skull's enforcer. He battled Captain America, <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Sam Wilson</a>, and <a href=\"/rikki-barnes/4005-24272/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24272\">Rikki Barnes</a> before being defeated. Unlike his mainstream version of Crossbones, this version was apparently mute and his face was never shown.</p><h3><a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a></h3><p>Crossbones was one of the many human villains that the <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">Hood</a> assembled which became that universe's incarnation of the <a href=\"/masters-of-evil/4060-7582/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-7582\">Masters of Evil</a>.

After the rescue, he took part in the liberation of Santo Rico from the <a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a>. After Magneto sent his forces to retaliate, Crossbones left Santo Rico along with many others who did not want to risk their lives against the overwhelming odds of Magneto's forces.</p><p>In the battle for the liberation of Santo Rico, a conversation between the Hood and Crossbones in the heat of battle reveals that Crossbones might have been working for different black-ops teams. The Hood noticed that he might have done missions like this before, to which Crossbones replies that he hasn't done it in a while but it is hard to forget how to do it. He may have as well been a mercenary in this reality.</p><h3>Ultimate Crossbones</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3924717-cross.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3924717\" data-ratio=\"0.51943462897527\" data-width=\"566\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 566px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3924717-cross.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3924717\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Crossbones\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3924717-cross.png 566w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Crossbones\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3924717-cross.png 566w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3924717-cross.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Crossbones</figcaption></figure><p>In the Ultimate universe, Brock Rumlow is a teenage street punk and the leader of a gang called the Serpent Skulls. He battles <a href=\"/miles-morales/4005-79420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79420\">Miles Morales</a> and the <a href=\"/ultimates/4060-40504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">All-New Ultimates </a>in the aftermath of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dissolution.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Originally, Crossbones had no powers. However, Crossbones once developed powers as a consequence of <a href=\"/terrigenesis/4015-42287/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42287\">Terrigenesis</a> (exposure from the radioactive mist of the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\">Terringen Crystals</a>). These powers allow him to generate intense heat and fire them as beams at his enemies. However, the power vanished when his Thunderbolts teammates showed up. It may have been a subconscious reaction to keep his new powers secret or he may have just exhausted the power.</p><p>He possesses peak human strength, speed, and stamina. Daredevil once said Crossbones was difficult to predict in combat due to his high metabolism. He is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, being able to go toe-to-toe with <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> on multiple occasions. Crossbones was trained in combat by the <a href=\"/taskmaster/4005-4578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4578\">Taskmaster</a>; quickly advancing and becoming a teacher of combat at Taskmaster's school for criminals when he was just a teenager. He is also rather quick for a man of his stature. We've seen him dodge gunfire on various occasions, and Bullseye even remarked on his speed once. Crossbones is an excellent marksman with guns, crossbows, and throwing knives. He was able to tag <a href=\"/troll/4005-72910/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72910\">Troll</a> in the ear while she was lunging. He is experienced with torture and brainwashing methods. For instance, he once effectively \"reprogrammed\" Sin and almost did the same with Diamondback. Brock is an expert pilot, and has a very high degree of pain tolerance. We've seen him remain silent when an arrow stabbed him in the gut and he recently told Sin it'll \"take more than a few bullets and missiles to stop me.\" He is tough enough to have laughed off Captain America's attacks.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Various firearms (preferred Weapons: Colt M1911's or Berrettas) and a bowie knife. He also uses a collapsible wrist crossbow, a wrist spike, spring-loaded stiletto blades in his gauntlets, explosives and poisoned knives.</p><h2>Character Profile</h2><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'4\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 290 lbs</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Brown</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Black</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> American</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Ohio</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Occupation: </b>Mercenary</li><li><strong>Base of Operations:</strong> Mobile</li></ul><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3682322\" data-ratio=\"0.91277890466531\" data-width=\"493\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 493px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3682322\"><img alt=\"Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 493w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 493w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/3682322-crossbones.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow</figcaption></figure><p>Frank Grillo portrays Brock Rumlow in the film <em><a href=\"/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/4025-1542/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1542\">Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</a> </em>In sharp contrast to his comic book counterpart, Rumlow is introduced as a <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D. </a>agent and an ally of Cap and <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>, rather than a Neo-Nazi mercenary.

      "description": "<h2>Current Events</h2><p>Strange is currently back as a member of the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a>.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>At a young age, Stephen Strange had dreams of becoming a doctor. The eldest child of three, Strange was born in 1930 while his parents <a href=\"/eugene-strange/4005-25259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25259\">Eugene</a> and <a href=\"/beverly-strange/4005-25260/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25260\">Beverly Strange</a> were on vacation in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven he aided his younger sister<a href=\"/donna-strange/4005-21562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21562\"> Donna</a> when she was injured, which proved to be a formative experience for him, and he was inspired to attend med school after high school. Ironically, it was his inability to later save her from drowning when he was nineteen and on leave from college that undermined his belief in life’s meaning and the value of idealism. Nevertheless, he rapidly finished med school at a young age and became a successful neurosurgeon.</p><p>Strange displayed phenomenal talent in his chosen field, and quickly attained wealth and notoriety. The more successful he became, the more arrogant he grew. Eventually this led to estrangement from his family and the undoing of his relationship with a United Nations translator named Madeline Revell to whom he had proposed marriage. So distant and self-absorbed did he become that he refused to visit his father on his deathbed. His enraged younger brother <a href=\"/victor-strange/4005-21556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21556\">Victor</a> Strange berated him for this, and then was killed as he ran into traffic. Stephen then placed the body of his brother into cryogenic storage. At a much later stage Stephen attempted to restore his brother through magical means, but instead imbued him with the curse of vampirism.</p><p>A car accident that damaged the nerves in his hands changed everything for Stephen Strange. He was no longer able to be a surgeon, yet he refused to become an assistant or consultant, instead squandering his money traveling the world and searching for a cure. One day he heard a rumor of a mystical personage known as the <a href=\"/ancient-one/4005-2212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2212\">Ancient One</a> in Tibet. Marshaling the last of his inner and outer resources, Strange diligently searched until the fortress of the Ancient One was revealed to him. Though initially outraged that the aged mystic refused to cure his hands, Strange’s anger was quickly replaced by amazement when the reality of magical forces was demonstrated before his eyes as he witnessed an attack on the Ancient One.</p><p>Circumstances revealed to Strange that it was none other than <a href=\"/baron-mordo/4005-2213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2213\">Baron Mordo</a>, the Ancient One’s chief disciple, who was the perpetrator of the attack, and who continued to plot the destruction of the antediluvian mystic in an attempt to gain power. To his horror, Strange learned he was unable to reveal this after Mordo easily encircled him. Realizing the Ancient One was a force for good; Stephen selflessly abandoned his quest to restore his hands and committed himself to magical tutelage with the intention of foiling Mordo’s insidious scheme. By this act Strange proved himself to the Ancient One, to whom the entire melodrama had been transparent. Thus Doctor Strange put himself on the path to become the new Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension, yet gained a deadly enemy in Baron Mordo.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Doctor Strange was created by the writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> and made his first ever appearance in <a href=\"/strange-tales-the-human-torch-vs-the-wizard-and-paste-pot-pete/4000-110835/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-110835\">Strange Tales #110</a> in 1963.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/111025-57299-clea.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-111025\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1867/111025-57299-clea.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-111025\"><img alt=\"Strange and Clea\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1867/111025-57299-clea.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1867/111025-57299-clea.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1867/111025-57299-clea.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Strange and Clea</figcaption></figure><p>After many years of training, Strange returned to New York. He became a mystical consultant and started having interactions with the superhero community. After the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> formed and many superheroes began to surface, Doctor Strange found a friend in <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. Spider-Man helped him rescue a group of people from another dimension and suggested that Strange remove from their memory this traumatic experience, though this meant that they would forget his own heroism. Initially tricked into conflict with each other by <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> and Doctor Strange also formed an early alliance to combat the god of mischief.</p><p>Noteworthy among the good Doctor’s numerous foes over the years as Earth’s magical guardian were the Dread <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu</a>, <a href=\"/shuma-gorath/4005-14000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14000\">Shuma-Gorath</a>, <a href=\"/undying-ones/4005-27708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27708\">the Undying Ones</a>, and <a href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare</a>. Strange’s first battle with Dormammu ensued when the powerful demigod of the Dark Dimension attempted to invade earth’s plane as he perceived the wane of the Ancient One’s might. Strange was forced to duel Dormammu in the Dark Dimension, and though vastly out-powered by the god-like entity, Strange was able to tax Dormammu to the extent that the barrier separating beings know as the Mindless Ones from the rest of the Dark Dimension became compromised. A force of pure destruction, the Mindless Ones would have meant annihilation to the other denizens of Dormmamu’s realm, and Strange nobly contributed his power to his enemy to prevent their being unleashed.</p><p>Bound by whatever strange honor as applies to his daemonic ilk, Dormammu then called off his invasion and released Strange. They were to clash many times subsequently, however, and Dormammu has been one of Strange’s most implacable and powerful foes. It was during this adventure that Doctor Strange also met Clea, a beautiful but inexperienced mystic (the daughter of Umar, Dormmamu’s sister), who became Strange’s first apprentice, as well as his lover.</p><p>In one of his more bizarre adventures, Strange fought the demonic forces of Shuma-Gorath, an ancient Lovecraftian entity that coveted earth’s domination from the world’s distant past and this time threatened our reality using the very mind of Doctor Strange’s beloved mentor, the Ancient One. Though it agonized him, Strange was left with no choice but to obey his teacher and slay him to prevent the holocaust Shuma-Gorath would have unleashed upon the world. The Ancient One then ascended to become one with the being known as Eternity, while Strange inherited the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Sorcerer Supreme and Defenders</h3><p>The <a href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders</a> were born when Doctor Strange formed a bizarre team-up with the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, Namor, and later the Silver Surfer. These four strong personalities somehow managed to work together and started the unlikely super-team known as the Defenders to combat yet another world-conquering demonic threat, this time in the form of beings called the <a href=\"/undying-ones/4005-27708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27708\">Undying Ones</a> who were led by the evil and ancient <a href=\"/the-nameless-one/4005-30341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30341\">Nameless One</a>.</p><p>The Defenders went on to battle numerous threats both supernatural and mundane (so to speak), and were joined in an oft-changing roster that included such unlikely characters as the Silver Surfer, <a href=\"/\">Hellstorm</a>, the <a href=\"/\">Overmind</a>, <a href=\"/\">Valkyrie</a>, <a href=\"/\">Nighthawk</a>, and <a href=\"/hellcat/4050-6778/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6778\">Hellcat</a>.</p><h3>Dracula and the Montessi Formula</h3><p>In yet another impressive display of the capabilities of a Sorcerer Supreme, Strange opposed <a href=\"/dracula/4005-7206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\">Dracula</a> himself to rid the world, at least for a time, of the plague of vampirism.

Doctor Strange kept Dracula busy, while the others recited the Montessi Formula from <a href=\"/\">The</a> <a href=\"/the-darkhold/4055-45058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-45058\">Darkhold</a> and destroyed virtually all the world’s vampires, including Dracula.</p><p>Yet this very undoing for most of the world’s vampires interacted with the previous spells Stephen Strange had attempted in his resurrection of his brother Victor, causing Victor to rise from the grave as the undead. Later developments also allowed the resurrection of many of the destroyed Nosferatu, though Strange banished the Vampire Verses to another plane of existence</p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet</h3><p>Strange went on to battle a host of threats to the Earth dimension, at times battling cosmic entities such as the <a href=\"/\">In-Betweener</a>; participating in the power struggles over the dominion of the Dark Dimension between Clea, Umar, and Dormammu; and joining other heroes to oppose <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> in his attempt to gain the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>; to name but a few. He has triumphed over others bearing the title Sorcerer Supreme, such as <a href=\"/\">Salome</a>, the first Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, and <a href=\"/\">Shanzar</a>, the Sorcerer Supreme of another dimension. Though he at first resisted such calls because of his duties as Earth’s mystical protector, Strange was eventually drawn into a 5,000 year battle against the Trinity of Ashes on the side of the <a href=\"/\">Vishanti</a>. Because of the magical nature of the realm in which he fought, or because of his innate power, Strange was absent from his home dimension for this conflict for only a few months in everyone else’s perceptions and appeared to age but little.</p><h3>Secret Defenders and Midnight Sons</h3><p>Though unquestionably a mighty force for good that has saved the Earth and even the universe from destruction multiple times, Doctor Strange found it necessary to have heroes regroup themselves. He did so in the reformation of the Defenders, nicknamed the Secret Defenders. This group consisted of an ever changing roster of superheroes that where right for the job. Doctor Strange also played an important role in the formation of the <a href=\"/\">Midnight Sons</a>, whom battled an alien invasion and other occult creatures.</p><h3>Defenders Reformed and the Order</h3><p>Doctor Strange does continue to show a certain predilection for arrogance, as evidenced by his susceptibility to Yandroth’s manipulation when Namor, the Hulk, the Silver Surfer and himself banded together to essentially take over the world. <a href=\"/\">Yandroth</a> had banded the four together by an apparently unbreakable curse (because it was the will of <a href=\"/\">Gaea</a>) that forced them to be teleported to the scene whenever a threat to the Earth manifested. The curse also heightened their natural egotism and irritability, which for these four was considerable. Unwilling to be snatched away from their other responsibilities any time the curse decreed there was a threat, the four decided instead to form the Order, which would keep the world safe by taking control and preventing threats from arising. Opposed by the other heroes of earth, the four appeared to have the power to triumph, but they realized in time that Yandroth was mystically siphoning the power generated by their violence to resurrect himself with the power of a god.</p><p>While they called off their plans and dispersed, they would not surrender themselves to mortal authorities for judgment. Doctor Strange was able to convince Gaea to let the four serve her willingly, and the curse was broken.</p><h3>Civil War and World War Hulk</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757614\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5306427503737\" data-width=\"669\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 669px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-757614\"><img alt=\"STRANGE SMASH!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg 669w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg 627w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>STRANGE SMASH!</figcaption></figure><p>It was revealed that Doctor Strange had been a participant in the <a href=\"/illuminati/4060-40421/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40421\">Illuminati</a>, a group of superheroes whom tried to discuss the biggest threads in the universe and solve them themselves. Dr. Strange became a member of the New Avengers after the end of the<a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War, </a>which he did not become involved in. He assisted the team on their first mission to Japan, and was severely wounded. During their second mission, to defeat <a href=\"/the-hoods-gang/4060-50921/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50921\">The Hood's Gang</a>, Dr. Strange had to use extreme magic to take them all down.</p><p>Prior to the event of <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/4045-42294/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42294\">World War Hulk</a>, Strange was one of the Illuminati who voted to exile the Hulk because of his destructive tendencies. When the Hulk came back and demanded the presence of the those who exiled him, Strange infiltrated his mind as a way to calm him down, but Hulk knew this move all along and gave him the opportunity to break Strange's hands, so that he could not use his magic. Strange became desperate and drank a vial containing the essence of <a href=\"/\">Zom</a>, a powerful demon that he had once faced. When Strange and Hulk fought, Strange was winning but not before realizing that Zom is slowly influencing his actions. With this realization, he was defeated by Hulk and held captive in his make-shift gladiator arena of Madison Square Garden.</p><h3>Strange No More</h3><p>Strange later left the New Avengers feeling that he'd used too much dark magic, and must train in the use of light magic again. In the end, he failed in his duties as Sorcerer Supreme, thus his title is removed from him. In light of this he no longer wore his cloak of levitation nor the eye of Agamotto. Instead he went out to search for the new Sorcerer Supreme, hoping it was someone who had good intents instead of evil. The first person he visited was <a href=\"/\">Wiccan</a>, but there he was attacked by The <a href=\"/\">Hood</a> who was taken over by his demonic cape. With the help of Wiccan he managed to escape and went to the <a href=\"/\">New Avengers</a> for help.</p><p>Together they went to <a href=\"/\">Hellstorm</a> During the ride there, the eye of Agamotto glowed brightly and disapeared, according to Dr. Strange to the new Sorcerer Supreme. In the meantime the Hood was fighting Hellstorm but the fight was interrupted when a new player came in, <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a>, wearing the Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto.

Later during the Dark Reign Iron Man attempts to hide the information of the super heroes from <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> and wipes his mind clean which causes him to loose his intellect and after a beating by Osborn himself falls into a coma. Several attempts are made to revive him and soon Strange is called in to help. After traveling into Stark's mind he is able to bring him out of his dream and accept that he is Iron Man. While vulnerable Ghost arrives hoping to kill Stark but Strange comes out of his spell first and fights Ghost, but is wounded in battle. Iron Man awakens next and transports Ghost away with his own technology.</p><p>After Osborn finally snapped and attacked Asgard Steve Rogers was given Osborn's old position and invited Strange to once again join the Avengers and he accepts. Soon after joining a demonic force possessing Strange and Damian Hellstorm attacks Doctor Voodoo trying to take the Eye of Agamotto by force. The mystical item teleports itself to the Mansion but is chased by the same force going from Luke Cage to eventually Iron Fist. After releasing a demonic army and kidnapping Iron Fist the source of the assault takes on the form of The Ancient One but after realizing his actions are uncharacteristic it is revealed to be Agamotto himself. He claims the Vishanti are dead and he want's his eye back. The Avengers accept a challenge from him and imbue Wolverine with all their combined powers to fight against Agamotto. In end Voodoo uses the power of the eye to apparently kill both Agamotto and himself.</p><h3>Circle of Four</h3><p>When Blackheart tried to use a Hell created Centrifuge to plunge Earth into Hell, Strange and Daimon Hellstorm were present to try and prevent this. However, Johnny Blaze had already placed an amulet, given to Hawkeye by Strange, on the border of Las Vegas, preventing Hell from stretching any further.</p><p>However, while <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Venom</a>, <a href=\"/thaddeus-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">Red Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a> and the new <a href=\"/ghost-rider/4005-4268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4268\">Ghost Rider</a> fight within the barrier to prevent Hell and Blackheart from succeeding, Strange and Daimon work from the outside to prevent Hell spreading further, when the amulet shatters. They battle fiercely until Daimon gives in, under the persuasion of Blackheart. Fortunately, the four heroes within find a way to reverse the march of Hell and to defeat Blackheart, freeing Strange and Daimon, who notices that the four heroes have been marked with pentagrams similar to his own.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men</h3><p>Dr. Strange took part in the battle between the Avengers and the X-Men over the return of the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a> to earth. He battled <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a> in her domain of Limbo, but without the powers of the <a href=\"/sorcerer-supreme/4015-55956/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55956\">Sorcerer Supreme</a> he was ultimately defeated by her. Magik took advantage of this by posing as Strange and teleporting the X-Men away from their impending arrest at the hands of the Avengers. After the Phoenix empowers five prominent X-Men the Avengers are forced to go on the run.</p><p>As skirmishes break out between the X-Men and the Avengers, Dr. Strange is seen providing magical assistance such as using illusions of the Scarlet Witch to intimidate the <a href=\"/phoenix-five/4060-59234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59234\">Phoenix Five</a> and teleporting teams away from one-sided fights. When the final assault is launched against Cyclops, Strange uses the Crimson Bands of <a href=\"/cyttorak/4005-24949/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24949\">Cyttorak</a> to bind the Phoenix avatar while <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a> pleads with and then attacks his former student mentally.

Dr. Strange uses mystical energy invoked upon by spells/incantations or by the power of divine beings to manipulate forces of the universe including projection of mystic energy as bolts, slashes, binds, shields, or a scattered array of energy appearing like electricity, manipulating matter and various energies (physical or spiritual) even transmutation of matter, controlling the elements, opening or sealing mystical portals to other realms, teleportation or dimensional travel, reality warping and control over dimension, seeing through or casting illusions, invisibility and intangibility through astral projection, vast mental powers such as telepathy and telekinesis, communication with the dead and spiritual entities, seeing the future or past, manipulating dreams, removing spirits or placing them back into bodies, summoning supernatural beings, or using the powers of supernatural items.</p><p>Many of Doctor Strange’s powers are a function of his ability to manipulate the ambient mystical energy of the Marvel Universe. With this ability Dr. Strange can perform many functions. Commonly this is seen as energy attacks that range from low power to planet destroying, transmutation, telekinesis, teleportation, protective shields, etc. He uses this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety.</p><p>Dr. Strange can also channel the virtually unlimited energy of nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings--known as Principalities--to empower his spells. This can take the form of stating what he wants to occur. This ability to be a conduit to multi-versal power sources has given rise to the phrase \"Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes\". He is quite capable of utilizing power that is considered \"black magic\", though he tends to do so only under extreme exigency. Though he rarely has, he can absorb the power of even a cosmic or semi-deity entity. Doctor Strange has a pact with Eternity possibly allowing him to live as long as the Ancient One and others before him have.</p><p>Doctor Strange has been noted calling upon many sorcerous phrases invoking certain entities, usually the above-mentioned Principalities. One example:</p><p><i>“Seven rings hath Raggador, from indigo to deepest black, Yet Oshtur grant me something more: The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak!”</i></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176330\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.785\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176330\"><img alt=\"Eye of Agamotto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eye of Agamotto\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eye of Agamotto</figcaption></figure><p>This phrase for instance, would cause unbreakable magical bonds to appear, capable of constraining even the Hulk. In addition to <a href=\"/\">Cyttorak</a> and <a href=\"/\">Oshtur</a>, among the beings of power called upon by Strange are all-seeing <a href=\"/\">Agamotto</a> and hoary <a href=\"/\">Hoggoth</a>, who along with Oshtur form the triad known as the eternal Vishanti; the Seraphim; Cthon (who created the Darkhold tome); Gaia; <a href=\"/\">Ikonn</a>; Dormammu (rarely) and the hell-lord <a href=\"/\">Satannish</a>. Sometimes it appears the substance of mystical realms is invoked rather than the beings who rule over them, as when Strange summons the Flames of the Faltine (the birthplace dimension of Dormammu, but also particular energy beings who rule there). This may explain why Strange is able to call upon such evil entities as Cthon and Satannish to power certain spells, yet not be in their service.</p><p>Certain beings are typically invoked for particular effects, such as Ikonn for illusions, the Seraphim for protective effects like shields and the like, Cyttorak for bindings, Agamotto for dispelling negativity and revealing the truth, etc. Other magical constructs commonly employed through such agencies are the Vapors of Valtoor, the Chains of Krakkan, and the Seven Suns of Cinnibus. Doctor Strange seems to be more so than anyone else under the favored patronage of the powerful Vishanti.</p><h3>Magical Artifacts</h3><p>The Sorcerer Supreme possesses a formidable arsenal of magical artifacts, two of which are particularly recognizable-- the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation. The <a href=\"/eye-of-agamotto/4055-55701/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55701\">Eye of Agamotto</a> is an artifact with many uses, such as vastly extending Dr. Strange's psychic abilities, inter dimensional travel, emitting a light that pierces all deception and is anathema to evil beings, serving as a protective talisman, and other feats. It can be used as an almost irresistible offensive weapon, though Strange rarely does so. Similar to <a href=\"/\">Mjolnir</a>, the Eye can only be used by those it deems as morally worthy. The Cloak of Levitation has been a third set of hands for Dr. Strange, responding to his thoughts to entangle opponents, and allowing him to fly and levitate. It is virtually indestructible and has shielded him from attacks as well.</p><p>Strange also possesses the Orb of Agamotto, a sort of hyper-powerful crystal ball that allows clairvoyant perception of anywhere in any dimension or realm. Other powerful artifacts in his possession include the Book of the Vishanti, the Darkhold tome, and the Wand of Watoomb. His abode in Greenwich Village known as the Sanctum Sanctorum, both defies normal spatial law and is of such magical potency in its protections that it may be considered an artifact itself. Doctor Strange has recently also come into the possession of the Soul Gem.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-295 What If...? X-Men: Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>After Apocalypse expanded his reign all over the world without any incarnation of the X-Men to challenge him, the Defenders rose twenty-years later to overthrow Apocalypse.</p><p>Doctor Strange assisted the Defenders, but died during their ventures. The Eye of Agamotto was inherited by Brother Voodoo, who became the new Sorcerer Supreme.</p><p>Through his death, the Defenders learned the truth of their reality, which branched from mainstream reality when Legion traveled back in time and killed both Xavier and Magneto.</p><h3>Earth-311</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-84248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.735\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-84248\"><img alt=\"Earth-311 1602\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth-311 1602\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Earth-311 1602</figcaption></figure><p>Stephen Strange of the Marvel 1602 reality served as Queen Elizabeth I's magician and mystical adviser, taking the place of the historical figure John Dee.

With his dying breath, Strange cryptically tells Iron Man that this was the only way, hinting that there may yet be some way to defeat Thanos.</p><h4><a href=\"/avengers-endgame/4025-2360/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-2360\">Avengers: Endgame</a> (2019)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7117391\" data-ratio=\"0.49833333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7117391\"><img alt=\"Strange during the final battle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Strange during the final battle\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7117391-endgame%20strange.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Strange during the final battle</figcaption></figure><p>In the follow-up, Doctor Strange and the other deceased heroes are resurrected after the Hulk uses the Infinity Stones to bring back Thanos' victims. Doctor Strange plays a major role in the final battle against Thanos' army, teleporting many of the restored heroes to the ruins of Avengers Compound for the final confrontation. Strange's cryptic words to Iron Man are also made clear when Tony realizes that the only way to destroy Thanos is to sacrifice his own life by using the Infinity Stones once more.

He had a decent childhood until Amberson lost most of the family fortune after the failure of his invention company, which had Amberson becoming alcoholic and violent. Young Norman and his mother would often be the targets of physical and psychological abuse by Amberson to compensate for his failures. This abuse had Norman realize that only the strong survive and that he will never be weak. This realization caused him to kill the family's dog, seeing it as one less problem in his life.</p><p>On one stormy and thunderous night, in order to cure his son's fear of the dark, Amberson locked Norman alone in one of the family's dark empty houses where Norman encountered and feared a \"green, goblin-like\" monster stalking him. Alone in the dark, Norman feared the monster would eat him once the darkness is replaced by the light, so he came to grip with the darkness, wishing it would never leave him. That night, he realized that the Darkness is better than the light.</p><p>Encounters like these made Norman develop a need for power and wealth so he would not become a failure like his father. He sought to regain the wealth he once had and he would stop at nothing to reach his goal.</p><p>Norman attended <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a> with a science scholarship and received degrees in chemistry and electrical engineering. While at ESU, he met and fell in love with a young woman named Emily. Despite his hunger for power and wealth, Emily was able to provide some balance in the young man and bring out the best in him. The two would marry and have a son, <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harold Osborn</a>. Norman loved Emily tremendously, but the good times would not last and Emily died shortly after Harry's birth. Norman is left a miserable, misguided, insane, single father. Without Emily there to give his life any light, he re-dedicates himself to wealth and power, neglecting Harry in the process.</p><p>After graduating in business and chemistry majors, Norman founded his own company, <a href=\"/oscorp-industries/4020-56725/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56725\">OsCorp</a>, with his old science professor, Dr. <a href=\"/professor-mendel-stromm/4005-31354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31354\">Mendel Stromm</a>. He would become successful and wealthy yet a ruthless businessman and always power hungry. When Stromm borrows money from the company accounts, Osborn seizes the opportunity and turns Stromm over to the police for embezzlement, leaving Norman, the sole owner of the company.</p><p>With Stromm now in jail, Osborn decides to continue working on the strength-enhancing formula Stromm had been working on in order to sell it to the highest bidder. Osborn tries to re-make the formula following Professor Stromm's notes. In order to perfect the formula, Osborn uses his employees as test subjects. One of those employees is Nels Van Adder, who went on a killing spree as the red, goblin-like monster called the \"<a href=\"/proto-goblin/4005-13735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13735\">Proto-Goblin</a>\" who attempted to kill Osborn at his laboratory but was saved by <a href=\"/arthur-stacy/4005-13737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13737\">Arthur Stacy</a> and <a href=\"/captain-george-stacy/4005-2479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2479\">George Stacy</a>. After the failed attack, Norman finds more of Stromm's notes in his old desk.</p><p>He is certain the new notes are the missing piece to the formula, however when Osborn uses the new information, the mixture turns bright green and explodes in his face. He is hospitalized, but recovers at an incredible, super-human rate. He realizes the explosion not only increased his strength, but also his intelligence. This pushes the megalomaniac Norman Osborn over the edge, and his sanity is lost.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> had originally intended to have the Green Goblin an ancient mythological monster found in an Egypt-like sarcophagus. However, <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> re-imagined the Green Goblin and turned him into a human instead. The Green Goblin's whole conception was all Ditko's idea. The Green Goblin debuted in Amazing Spider-Man #14 and his secret identity wasn't known but he became instantly popular. Lee and Ditko disagreed on the character's alter-ego; Lee wanted it to be someone Spider-Man knew but Ditko preferred it be a new character to introduce a sense of realism to the stories. According to Ditko, he had intended to have <a href=\"/frederick-foswell/4005-12356/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12356\">Frederick Foswell</a> be the Green Goblin. This disagreement may have led to Ditko leaving Spider-Man and in issue #31, the Green Goblin was finally revealed as Norman Osborn.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The Green Goblin first appeared as a villain determined to rule the underworld and in order to do that he needed to prove himself by defeating New York's newest hero, <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. The Goblin's secret identity wasn't shown at first and he made several appearances where he would prove himself as a worthy foe for Spider-Man. The Goblin first appeared using a jet powered flying broomstick which was later replaced with the now iconic <a href=\"/goblin-glider/4055-55762/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\">Goblin Glider</a>.</p><p>The Green Goblin became even a bigger villainous threat when he became the first villain to uncover Spider-Man's secret identity as Peter Parker. He was also revealed as Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn</a>, further adding a sense of drama to the Spider-Man stories. However, he would lose the memory of being a super-villain and would often make appearances as Harry's kindhearted father but eventually, he would return to his villainous role.</p><p>Spider-Man's arch-enemy had always been <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a> until the Green Goblin killed Peter's girlfriend, <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>, elevating the Goblin to the status of being Spider-Man arch-enemy who has hurt Spider-Man more than any other villain. After Gwen's death, Osborn would seemingly die as well and would disappear for the rest of the Silver Age from the Spider-Man comics.</p><p>During his absence, his son Harry would follow in his father's footsteps and become the Green Goblin himself. Also, Harry's psychiatrist <a href=\"/bart-hamilton/4005-34978/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34978\">Bart Hamilton</a> would take up the mantle as well. By the end of the Silver Age and the beginning of the Modern Age, the <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Hobgoblin</a>, a Green Goblin copycat, would become Spider-Man's arch-enemy. Osborn would return in the late 90's when it is revealed that he has been manipulating everyone from the start. His rivalry with Spider-Man becomes even more intense when he kills <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Ben Reilly</a>, Peter's \"brother\". Norman would return to the role of \"evil businessman\" and would torture Peter with the fact of being one of the few people to know of his dual identity.</p><p>Further into the Modern Age, Osborn's insanity would be explored as well as his affinity and respect for Peter as an opponent. Norman's character would evolve to show that despite the mutual hatred he has with Spider-Man, he does possess a sense of respect and admiration for Spider-Man in his own twisted way. He would grow to consider Peter as his own son and attempts to have him carry on his legacy as the Goblin Heir. He later attempts to have Peter kill him in an epic battle after continuously provoking Peter and invading his life. Norman's attacks on Peter would become personal as he attacks Peter's friends and family, intensifying their mutual hatred.</p><p>During the Civil War, Norman becomes distant from Spider-Man when he becomes the Leader of the Thunderbolts and his role as leader becomes explored as well as his constant fight against his insanity. He would be portrayed as being considered by himself a hero doing the right thing and shaping a world in his own vision of righteousness and perfection. This portrayal is further explored in Dark Reign where Osborn becomes the leader of the world's main super-hero team and he tries to use his power to shape the world as he sees it fit and he truly believes that he deserves public adulation and he is annoyed that other so-called \"heroes\" are receiving it instead.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Vendetta against Spider-Man</h3><p>The insane Osborn sought to take over the criminal underworld and so, remembering his encounter with the terrifying green monster that had haunted his childhood nightmares, Norman decided to instill fear in the hearts of his enemies as the Green Goblin. In order to establish his reputation, the Goblin decided to kill Spider-Man. He sent two criminals, <a href=\"/scorcher/4005-25579/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25579\">Scorcher</a> and <a href=\"/headsman/4005-58416/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58416\">Headsman</a> after the hero but they were swiftly defeated. This where Norman decided to take matters into his own hands and seek Spider-Man himself.</p><p>First, the Green Goblin arranges a meeting with the <a href=\"/enforcers/4060-32265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers</a>, who are seeking revenge against the Web-Slinger for an earlier defeat. After intimidating the criminals, the Goblin promises them that they will have their revenge if they do what he says.</p><p>He arranges for Spider-Man to at a Hollywood movie studio where Spider-Man is ambushed by the Enforcers and the Goblin himself using a flying broomstick (which later becomes a Glider) and stun-bombs (which later become Pumpkin bombs). Despite interference by the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, whose cave they had accidentally stumbled upon, Spider-Man manages to defeat the Enforcers but he was too tired to prevent the Goblin from escaping.</p><p>A few months later, the Green Goblin, using his new bat-shaped glider and pumpkin bombs, attacks the Web-Spinner at a Spider-Man fan-club, where the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> also joins the fight. Spider-Man had the upper hand until he overhear <a href=\"/liz-allan/4005-15408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\">Liz Allen</a>'s father talking about Aunt May having a heart attack. Once Spider-Man heard the news, he immediately left the battle, having the crowd turn against him and giving the Goblin an impressive reputation.</p><p>Later on, the Green Goblin assaults a big gang leader named <a href=\"/lucky-lobo/4005-38640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38640\">Lucky Lobo</a>'s base in an attempt to take over his gang and become \"The King of Crime\". The Goblin then pretends to be helping the police in capturing Lobo, but he was stopped and defeated by Spider-Man when the Goblin was out of pumpkin bombs but still managed to escape because Spider-Man was out of web-fluid. In another attempt to take down Spider-Man, the Goblin teamed-up with the <a href=\"/crime-master/4005-31699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31699\">Crime-Master</a> ending with the death of Crime-Master and the Goblin managed to escape yet again.</p><h3>Discovering Spider-Man's Identity</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541716\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/541716-gre.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0568181818182\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/541716-gre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541716\"><img alt=\"Identity revealed\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/541716-gre.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/541716-gre.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-width=\"605\"></a><figcaption>Identity revealed</figcaption></figure><p>After so many defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin soon begins to view Spider-Man not just as an obstacle in controlling of the underworld but as a personal rival and becomes obsessed with the Web-Slinger. The Goblin stages a robbery in an effort to catch Spider-Man’s attention. During the fight with the robbers, Spider-Man is exposed to a gas, designed by the Green Goblin, to dull his Spider-Sense. This allows the Goblin to track Spider-Man and learn his identity as Peter Parker, becoming the first villain to ever discover Spider-Man's alter-ego.</p><p>The Goblin then confronts Spider-Man outside his home and he is able to subdue Spider-Man. Back at his waterfront hideout while Spider-Man is restrained, the Green Goblin reveals his true identity as Norman Osborn. The Goblin then frees Spider-Man because he feels it would be a hollow victory to defeat an impaired Spider-Man. The Goblin is confident because Spider-Man has yet to defeat him in battle. During the fight that follows, the Goblin is knocked unconscious by an “electro-chemical charge”. His exposure to the charge leaves with temporary amnesia and forgetting the last few years, including ever becoming the Green Goblin. Spider-Man changes out of the Green Goblin costume into his civilian clothing and the authorities believe the Green Goblin died in the fire.</p><p>Later, as Norman is living a Goblin-free life, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a> confronts him, since Kraven believes he is the Goblin’s messenger. Kraven claims the Green Goblin offered him $20,000 to kill Spider-Man and he wants an advance on the bounty. Unfortunately, Kraven cannot collect from the Goblin directly because he believes the Goblin is dead. Unable to locate Norman, Kraven tries to kidnap Harry Osborn, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Norman arrives during the fight and Kraven immediately attacks him. Kraven soon realizes he knows nothing about the Green Goblin nor the money owed to Kraven. Kraven leaves Norman unhurt.</p><p>Eventually, Norman’s memory starts to come back and he is troubled by visions of the Goblin and Spider-Man that he can’t totally explain. During a speech by Captain George Stacy on super-villains, Norman’s memory is sparked by images of the Green Goblin battling Spider-Man. He remembers that he is the Green Goblin and he’s ready to exact his revenge on Peter Parker. Norman holds a gathering for Harry and his friends in order to get Peter in a vulnerable situation. Peter creates a diversion and gets out of the Osborn’s home, but the Goblin has gone to <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a>’s house. A fight ensues and Spider-Man is exposed to a psychedelic bomb, which the Goblin uses to render Spider-Man helpless. However, Spider-Man soon recovers and he uses the same psychedelic bomb on the Goblin, which induces another spell of amnesia.</p><p>Some time later, after watching <a href=\"/mary-jane/4005-13380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13380\">Mary Jane Watson</a>’s play, a door Norman sees in a back alley-way troubles him. The door turns out to be an old Goblin hideout and when he goes in; his memory is sparked and he again becomes the Green Goblin. Spider-Man confronts him, a fight ensues and the Goblin thinks he has left Spider-Man to fall to his death. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn overdoses on pills in an attempt to get over Mary Jane. Harry is taken to the hospital for treatment. A second battle between the Goblin and Spider-Man occurs and Spider-Man guides the Goblin on his glider to see Harry in the hospital. The vision of Harry causes Norman to have a psychological breakdown, causing him to once again forget he is the Green Goblin and Peter is Spider-Man.</p><h3><b>Norman's Death and Return</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-106875\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.98\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-106875\"><img alt=\"Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/106875-141927-gwen-stacy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen</figcaption></figure><p>The shock that caused Norman’s most recent amnesia was ultimately the stress that leads Norman to unleash the Goblin's fury again. Harry's drug addiction resurfaces and becomes bed ridden from overdosing on LSD. The final straw is news that his beloved company’s stock is down 13%. Norman loses control, and starts to have delusions involving Spider-Man. He eventually revert to the Green Goblin persona and once again plans to get revenge upon Spider-Man. This time Norman abducts Gwen Stacy who was at Peter’s home waiting for him. Spider-Man tracks the Goblin to the Brooklyn Bridge, where a fight ensues and the Goblin throws Gwen off the side of the bridge. In one of the most memorable comic panels of the Silver Age, Spider-Man shoots a web line to catch the falling Gwen, but the jolt from the sudden stop appears to snap Gwen's neck. To this day Peter still feels guilty for her death, in the same way he feels remorse for his <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben</a>'s death. Enraged by the Goblin's actions, Spider-Man continues fighting the Goblin on the bridge, But Spider-Man's fury blinds him, and he gets sloppy and a bridge cable knocks him out allowing the Goblin to escape. Peter eventually tracks down the Goblin at his hideout. In the subsequent fight, Spider-Man is able to pummel the Goblin in a fit of rage but manages to stop himself from delivering the killing blow. However, the Goblin sends his <a href=\"/goblin-glider/4055-55762/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55762\">Goblin Glider</a> to hit Spider-Man from behind. Spider-Man ducks to avoid the glider and it impales the Goblin, seemingly killing him. Peter does not feels a sense of justice in watching him die. There is a mysterious figure watching the events transpire, which is later revealed to be Harry Osborn.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344571\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1344571-green_goblin_18.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.58260869565217\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1344571-green_goblin_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344571\"><img alt=\"The Green Goblin's \"death\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1344571-green_goblin_18.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54400/1344571-green_goblin_18.jpg 460w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54400/1344571-green_goblin_18.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Green Goblin's \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Green Goblin's \"death\"</figcaption></figure><p>While is believed to be dead, many people raid his Goblin hideouts and use his Goblin technology.

He awakens inside a morgue. He sees Harry bribing the mortician and decides to let Harry have a chance to be a man and take up the mantle of the Green Goblin.

Meanwhile Mary Jane is pregnant with Peter’s child. Norman Osborn kills Seward Trainer, a friend of Ben Reilly. Moreover, Norman is now returning from hiding and coming to confront Peter. Ben and Peter fight Gaunt and neutralize him, however during the fight Mary Jane goes into labor. Osborne kills Gaunt for his failure.

When Peter awakes, Osborn reveals himself to Peter, explaining that he survived the glider incident with his healing factor, that he had been in hiding, and that he has returned because he was tired of Peter rebounding from all the things he’s thrown at him and he wants final revenge. He also tells Peter that Ben Reilly was the actual clone. Norman reveals himself as the mastermind behind the entire Clone Saga hoax. He then leads Peter to the <a href=\"/daily-bugle-building/4020-55675/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55675\">Daily Bugle</a> where he wants Peter to watch as Norman kills all those close to him, before he murders Peter.</p><p>However, Ben sneaks all the hostages out of the Daily Bugle, and makes his way to Peter. Ben is impaled by the Goblin’s Glider, he had stepped in front of the glider in an attempt to save Peter and is killed. Peter hurls a bag of pumpkin bombs at the Green Goblin, which explode when they hit him, and the Goblin vanishes out of sight. Ben Reilly dies and his body disintegrates, revealing him as the actual clone. Peter does not find Norman's body, but he knows that he has not seen the last of Osborn. The real significance of this era of Norman Osborn's life is that from the moment he awoke in the morgue he was aware he was the Green Goblin, and his amnesic episodes are over.</p><p>Neither Norman Osborn nor the Green Goblin was seen for a while after those events. However Norman buys half of the Daily Bugle, and at the press conference states that he had been hiding in to avoid his enemies, which included Spider-Man. He also states that he came back because of the “smear campaign” against his family name by reporter Ben Urich. Urich had written a book called \"The Legacy of Evil\", which ousted Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin. Norman states, he has now dedicated himself to finding out who the real Green Goblin is. When Peter Parker returns to his ransacked home, he blames Osborn and goes to his apartment and beats him up. Unfortunately, the whole incident is caught on tape and the Daily Bugle puts a one million dollar reward on Spider-Man’s head.</p><p>During the Spider-Hunt saga, Dr. Jonas Meuller, (aka Dr. Angst), works with Osborn on a genetic construct that will stand in for the Green Goblin and prevent from further suspicion. Norman’s grandson, <a href=\"/normie-osborn/4005-11552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11552\">Normie Osborn</a>, is kidnapped by this construct “Green Goblin” and Spider-Man amongst others, try to find Normie. Spider-Man tracks down the construct Goblin and the Construct “dies” in an explosion that occurred during the fight. Normie is returned to Norman by <a href=\"/override/4005-6296/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6296\">Override</a> and <a href=\"/clarence-fielding/4005-23757/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23757\">Clarence Fielding</a>. It is later revealed that Norman himself had arranged the kidnapping of Normie by the alternate Goblin in an effort to sway the public beliefs away from him being the Green Goblin.</p><h3>Identity Crisis</h3><p>The reward on Spider-Man's head rises to Five Million Dollars after he is suspected of murdering a thug named Joey Z. Peter retires his Spider-Man costume and chooses to don four new costume identities, which have been nick-named \" <a href=\"/slingers/4060-43529/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43529\">The Slingers</a>\": <a href=\"/hornet/4005-4803/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4803\">The Hornet</a>, <a href=\"/ricochet/4005-2245/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2245\">Ricochet</a>, <a href=\"/dusk/4005-4805/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4805\">Dusk</a>, and <a href=\"/prodigy/4005-4804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4804\">Prodigy</a>. As the Dusk persona, Peter aids the <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a> who also seeks revenge on Norman Osborn. The Trapster threatens to kill Osborn, but Dusk stops him, and Osborn gets away. The Trapster (real name Pete Petruski) publicly confesses to having killed Joey Z and exonerates Spider-Man.

Each individual must choose to take part of the ritual with an open heart and conviction of purpose. The five participants are <a href=\"/madame-web/4005-10670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10670\">Madame Web</a>, <a href=\"/mattie-franklin/4005-41988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41988\">Martha “Matt” Franklin</a>, <a href=\"/override/4005-6296/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6296\">Gregory Herd</a> (aka Override), <a href=\"/morris-maxwell/4005-10669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10669\">Morris Maxwell</a>, and Norman himself. Meanwhile, Alison Mongrain, is making her way to Peter Parker to deliver some important information. She doesn’t reach Peter, but find Mary Jane and tell her that May Parker is still alive and at Norman’s hunting lodge upstate. Mary Jane tells Peter and he resolves to go after May, MJ tries to stop him, and tells Peter it could very possibly be just another of Norman’s traps. Meanwhile, after the Gathering of Five ritual, Osborn is convinced he has the gift of power.</p><p>Peter arrives at Norman’s hunting lodge and confronts Osborn, who is dressed as the Green Goblin. Norman claims he has grown tired of the personal vendetta he’s waged against Peter and their conflicts will soon come to an end. He also claims that he will release a “DNA bomb” to reshape the world in his image. A threat that appears very real when Peter hears reports that 50 people at Osborn Industry died when they “melted” out of their clothing. After neutralizing the Goblin, Spider-Man heads into the estate hoping to find his baby <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-3365/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3365\">May</a>, however, May Alison Mongrain misled MJ and was actually referring to Peter's deceased Aunt May.</p><p>Peter takes Aunt May to <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> to run tests on her. Reed believes she is human and not a clone, but the only way to be sure would be a DNA sample. Peter finds an old blood sample of May’s and brings it to Richards. When Peter returns to the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\">Baxter Building</a>, Reed tells Peter someone implanted a device at the base of May’s skull and if it is not removed soon she will die. Peter confronts Norman to find out what purpose the device serves, and Norman gladly offers the information. Firstly, the device is the “trigger” for the worldwide DNA bomb, if removed the bomb will go off. Second, this is the real Aunt May and the person who died in Amazing Spider-Man #400 was an actress Norman hired and infused with May’s genetic matrix. Norman as the Green Goblin, then defeats Spider-Man and unmasks him publicly.</p><h3>Norman Osborn’s True Gift</h3><p>It is later revealed that this was Norman’s delusion and Spider-Man had actually defeated him. The Gathering of Five ritual had actually given Osborn the gift of madness. Reed Richards neutralizes the device in May’s skull and she is recuperating fine. Norman is taken to the Bellevue psychiatric ward where he is unmasked by the staff, they cry out, “his face,” but suddenly a group of Scriers take out the guards and doctors and kidnap Osborn claiming he “belongs to the Scriers”.</p><h3>The Goblin Heir</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070117\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg\" data-ratio=\"1.5158850226929\" data-width=\"661\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 661px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1070117\"><img alt=\"Killer Returns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 661w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 633w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Killer Returns\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 661w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 633w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1070117-norman05.jpeg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Killer Returns</figcaption></figure><p>Norman Osborn, dependent on drugs to sustain his sanity, is in a safe house with his friend, ally, and Osborn Industry employee <a href=\"/donald-menken/4005-24649/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24649\">Donald Menken</a>, who is one of the Scriers who removed Osborn from the psychiatric ward.

One day after she accidentally walks in on Norman in his Goblin costume, his first instinct is to throw a gas bomb, not knowing it was her and almost kills her. Osborne decides to come clean and reveal his life story to Kolina.</p><p>Norman also evaluates his recent battles with Spider-Man, and feels the time is perfect for another attack due to Mary Jane’s death and the loss of all Parker's savings. Norman disguises himself as a mailman and tampers with Peter and <a href=\"/randy-robertson/4005-17620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17620\">Randy Robertson</a>’s mail.

Peter hallucinations continue. Norman kidnaps Peter, and when Peter wakes up Norman is holding him hostage, determined to make Peter face the darkness and become an Osborn. Norman tortures Peter trying to break Peter’s spirit and get him to accept the darkness. He tells Peter, he realized Peter was the rightful heir while at the hospital visiting the birth of Normie Osborn and saw Peter was secretly visiting the hospital as well. Norman claims he has won, because for a brief moment during the torture, Peter “blinked” at the darkness, and Peter would no longer be able to maintain his altruistic facade. Peter eventually overcomes the mind games and rejects being the heir to the Osborn legacy.</p><h3><b>A Death in the Family</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687206\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.9251336898396\" data-width=\"187\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 187px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:192.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-687206\"><img alt=\"Loss In The Family\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\" data-width=\"187\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg 187w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loss In The Family\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/687206-norman.jpg 187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\" data-width=\"187\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loss In The Family</figcaption></figure><p>The story begins with Norman visiting his son, Harry’s grave, and in Norman's introspection he states that he had reached out to Peter and that he had refused him, and that Norman can’t let things stand at that. Meanwhile, Peter is haunted by a dream and he has no one he can confide in, he attempts to confide in Mary Jane, but decides not to talk to her (she's in California and they aren’t together). As if drawn to each other, Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in the middle of a rain storm, a fight ensues and Norman leaves Peter with an invitation to a family reunion... and it's going to be a funeral. The Green Goblin then appears on TV stating that it was Spider-Man who was responsible for the death of Gwen Stacy and that he had originally planned to catch her after her drop. Peter confronts Norman while Norman is with some clients and Norman tells Peter that one of them, either Peter or Norman, has to die. The Green Goblin than force feeds Flash Thompson, a recovering alcoholic, whiskey and then has him drive a truck that crashes into <a href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\">Midtown High</a>. Due to the accident, Flash goes into a coma.</p><p>Norman offers to repair Midtown High since it was his company’s truck that crashed into the school. Later, Norman has Peter meet him at one of Osborn’s chemical companies. While there, Norman states that he plans to murder, Normie Osborn, his grandchild. The fight continues and Norman states that only one of them can leave there today and that he has operatives stationed all over the place and they are ready to kill those close to Peter at any moment. Peter Parker, who becomes quickly enraged, pummels the Green Goblin, beating him mercilessly, and it appears that the Green Goblin has given up. Just before delivering the final blow, Peter releases Norman and says that he can’t kill him. The two even share a laugh at this point. He then confides in Norman about his dream at which point Peter realizes the meaning of the dream. Everyday he refuses to hate Norman for what he did, Gwen lives, if he caves into the anger she dies. So he won’t cave into the anger. Peter calls Norman’s bluff concerning killing young Normie. As the story arc closes, the two rivals share a laugh, a scene that is a sort homage to the conclusion to <a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a>’s <a href=\"/batman-the-killing-joke/4050-19967/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19967\">Batman: The Killing Joke</a>. It appears as though Norman set this whole thing up because he wanted Peter to kill him, that was the “death in the family”, Norman contemplates suicide at the conclusion. The ramifications from this story arc are numerous; however, one of the major results is Flash becoming paraplegic.</p><h3>The Pulse</h3><p>A reporter for the Daily Bugle, Terri Kidder, follows a lead she was given from a friend concerning missing people at Oscorp. Her friend is an employee at Oscorp. In an attempt to break the story, she tricks her way into the office of Norman Osborn to question him about the missing people. Her body is then found dead and mutilated in the reservoir on the east side of Central Park. Ben Urich puts the pieces together and eventually the police come to investigate Norman for the missing bodies, but when they arrive at Norman’s office they don’t find Norman, instead, they find the Green Goblin and hell breaks loose. Spider-Man intervenes and neutralizes the Goblin, who nearly kills both Ben Urich and <a href=\"/jessica-jones/4005-2265/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2265\">Jessica Jones</a>, who is <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>’s girlfriend. Luke Cage, angered by the attacks on his girlfriend, goes after Norman after he had already surrendered to the authorities. To escape this attack Norman dons his Goblin apparel, but Luke subdues him. The story concludes with Osborn being confirmed publicly named as the Green Goblin and being placed in jail.</p><h3>The Last Stand</h3><p>This story arc picks up immediately after the events of The Pulse, where Spider-Man is now in the process of hunting down the Green Goblin. He succeeds and the Goblin is brought into prison, unfortunately for Peter, Norman is suing Spider-Man for aggravated assault charges due to the nature of which Spider-Man overpowered him. Peter returns home, he receives a phone call in the middle of the night that someone has defaced <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben</a>’s grave. Peter goes to the grave site to see. Unfortunately, this was a decoy because his Aunt May was kidnapped from his home while he was gone. He confronts Norman in prison, thinking that he is to blame, and Norman plays mind games with Peter as to whether or not he is involved, basically providing no information for him. Interestingly, in the course of the conversation we learn that Norman's age is 55.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Mac Gargan</a> approaches Peter Parker, claiming to be the one responsible for kidnapping his Aunt May, and he says that he was working for Norman Osborn, but that this kidnapping is the “tip of the iceberg” for Norman’s plans. Gargan tells Peter the history of super-villains and that they were created in the forties when the “ruling class”, companies responsible for putting governments into office, desired to keep emerging super heroes at bay, and away from discovering the corruptness which this \"ruling class\" has been utilizing to prevail. This “divide and conquer” tactic led to contracted super villains, of which Norman Osborn was one of the favorites, until he went out of control with the Goblin persona. This corrupt administration is no longer operating but there were some famous names in the “original cabal”. Due to that Norman has become a target because he knows where “all the bodies are buried” and he is a sitting duck in prison. So Norman Osborn orchestrated the kidnapping of Aunt May in order to solicit Peter’s help to break him out of prison, he has to help him or Aunt May dies. Peter reluctantly decides to help break him out, and in the process of doing so he receives help from the Black Cat. Peter successfully breaks Norman out, but when he does, the Green Goblin has a surprise for him. The Green Goblin double crosses Peter and has the <a href=\"/sinister-twelve/4060-40481/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40481\">Sinister Twelve</a>, a group composed of classic Spider-Man villains like the <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, amongst others waiting for him. Fortunately, Mary Jane called <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> as well as the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> arrived to help neutralize them. The Green Goblin leaves to go kill Mary Jane, and Spider-Man then goes after him. They meet on what looks to be the George Washington Bridge. A mind controlled Doctor Octopus, who has been programmed to kill Norman Osborn, arrives at the scene. A lightning bolt strikes and hits the Goblin, who was holding his Goblin Glider in the air, as well as Doc Ock and sends both of them plunging into the water below. Peter finds his Aunt May buried alive in the grave site of his Uncle Ben, he had reached her just in time to save her life. The story concludes with a letter written from Norman to Peter thanking him for providing the intellectual and physical challenge as Spider-Man as they have provided his life with both structure and meaning.</p><h3><b>Sins Past</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76460\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.69400630914826\" data-width=\"317\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 317px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-76460\"><img alt=\"Two Goblins\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-width=\"317\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg 317w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Two Goblins\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/76460-71083-green-goblin.jpg 317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" data-width=\"317\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Two Goblins</figcaption></figure><p>This controversial story-arc begins with Peter receiving a letter in the mail, postmarked 2004 (the year of the story's publication), from Gwen Stacy. There is only one page in the letter and its clear information is missing. Peter takes the letter to Detective Lamont, who passes the letter on to forensics in order to figure out if something was written on the back side of the paper, which might possibly provide more insight into what is going on. While visiting Gwen’s grave, Peter is attacked by two unknown assailants, one male and one female. Lamont gives the letter back with what could be retrieved from the original letter and it is revealed that Gwen was pregnant with twins and that she had given birth to them, their names were <a href=\"/gabriel-stacy/4005-43784/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43784\">Gabriel</a> and <a href=\"/sarah-stacy/4005-45762/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45762\">Sarah</a>.

She had given birth to the children in Europe, where they remained. This provides Peter the insight into some of Norman's prior motivations including why he chose Gwen of all people to kill and why he went Europe after his “death”. Also, Gwen would not let Norman have the children, which explains why Norman was so hungry for an heir and wanted Peter to fill that role. Gwen had wanted Peter to help raise the children. There was still the question as to why the children were as old as they were, the time line didn't make sense. The answer: Norman's exposure to the Goblin formula. Norman’s Goblin formula, which has integrated into his DNA and provides him with rapid regenerative capabilities, had been passed down to his offspring and explains their rapid aging. Unfortunately, the twins are now dying and need Peter’s help in order to stay alive. Norman, while in Europe, fed the children the false information that Peter was their father and that he was responsible for their mother’s death. At the Brooklyn Bridge, Peter tells Sarah and Gabriel that Norman is their father, Sarah believes him, Gabriel does not and in the ensuing fight Gabriel inadvertently shoots Sarah. Peter gives Sarah his blood to keep her alive, meanwhile Gabriel remembers instructions he was given by Osborn to find a Goblin hideout. When he arrives there, Norman has a prerecorded message for him and an enhancing formula that should have curbed this aging process. He then dons the Grey Goblin costume. The Grey Goblin attacks Peter in the hospital, but Sarah steps in to help, Gabriel is knocked into the water and he washes up on shore with temporary amnesia.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>Osborn managed to survive his latest encounter with Spider-Man and escape to France but was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D agents and imprisoned. While in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Osborn watched in shock as Spider-Man publicly revealed his identity as Peter Parker, railing that Peter \"broke the rules!\". Parker also confirmed Osborn's identity as the Green Goblin and his role in the death of Gwen Stacy.</p><p>Norman is then approached by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are seeking his aid. The Goblin confronts and attacks Ben Urich in an alley, but S.H.I.E.L.D.'s nano-machines cause him to stop and collapse. In an attempt to encourage errant heroes to register with the government, S.H.I.E.L.D director Tony Stark decided to inject Osborn with nanites designed to keep him under control, and have him, as the Green Goblin, attack an <a href=\"/atlanteans/4060-13407/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13407\">Atlantean</a> espionage ring in New York, in order to have the Atlanteans seem as a threat to the USA, and encourage more heroes to join the Super Human Registration Act. However, Osborn had made a deal with a shadowy figure who gave him a serum that overrides the nanites' control and as a result, he ended up killing and wounding many Atlanteans, even attempting to assassinate the Atlantean Ambassador but only succeeded in wounding him. He was then captured and imprisoned again by the police. However, Osborn was taken away from the police by operatives of the Commission of Super-Human Activities (CSA) whose role was to enforce the SHRA. After threatening the police, Osborn became increasingly scared and begged them to hold on to him, promising to tell them everything he knows.</p><h3><b>Director of Thunderbolts</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-430459\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5181818181818\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 660px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-430459\"><img alt=\"Osborn's Thunderbolts\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 660w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Osborn's Thunderbolts\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 660w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Osborn's Thunderbolts</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/commission-on-superhuman-activities/4060-42060/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42060\">CSA</a> (an American government organization far from S.H.I.E.L.D's control) appointed Norman Osborn as the new director of the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> after the collapse of the original roster and has been given pills in order to maintain his sanity.

As the new team's leader, Osborn has alternately used diplomacy, force, and humiliation to keep the field team in line, and enjoys the status and power he has, as well as his criminal career being quietly swept under the carpet. Osborn's favorite members are Venom, Moonstone and Bullseye, and his most hated are Songbird, Penance and Swordsman. However, in an attempt to become team leader herself, Thunderbolt Moonstone influenced attendants to switch his medication with placebos on alternate days, hoping Osborn will go insane once again and gets fired but her plan backfired. He has also forced the super-villain Whirlwind and his allies to secretly work for him directly. As a Director for the Commission on Superhuman Activities, Osborn was present and involved in a joint CSA/UN tribunal against <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, being aggressively against him and clashing with witness <a href=\"/doc-samson/4005-4315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4315\">Doc Samson</a>.</p><p>When four telepaths try to destroy the Thunderbolts from the inside, they target Osborn with hallucinations of his Goblin mask, eventually causing him to break down completely in response to Swordsman going rogue. Driven to become the Green Goblin again, he brutally assaults and crucifies Swordsman before being telepathically nudged into murdering the entire Thunderbolt Mountain staff. He engages Songbird in battle, and both knock each other unconscious. When Bullseye murders the four telepaths in their cells, all of the Thunderbolts return to normal.</p><h3><b>New Ways to Die</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-636987\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-636987\"><img alt=\"Hunting Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hunting Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/12840/636987-asm__569.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hunting Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>During the course of the One More Day storyline, which ended with the retcon of the previous two decades of Spider-Man continuity, the situation changes so that Norman's son, Harry, is revealed to be alive once more and no one (including Norman) knows Spider-Man's secret identity.</p><p>In this story, Mayoral candidate Randall Crowne, who was accused of running an illegal sweatshop by the Front Line, asks Norman's help in insuring his victory. But in return, Norman asks Crowne to use his contacts to arrange for the Thunderbolts to come to New York and hunt Spider-Man. First, he sent the team after the man who takes pictures of his long-time foe...Peter Parker. The Thunderbolts attacked Peter and attempt to force him into telling them where Spider-Man is. After he refused to co-operate, they ruined his apartment and left him with a warning. Norman also checked on his son Harry, who has bought the Coffee Bean, hoping to make it into a franchise, but this did not impress Norman at all.</p><p>Eventually, the Thunderbolts engaged Spider-Man and <a href=\"/eddie-brock/4005-6733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6733\">Eddie Brock</a> got involved and has become Anti-Venom. As Norman watches the battle between Venom, Anti-Venom and Spider-Man, he is attacked and threatened by the new goblin, Menace, who tells him to stop interfering in politics and leave town, but Norman tells him that he's only interested in Spider-Man, angering <a href=\"/menace/4005-50406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50406\">Menace</a> further, but Osborn defeated Menace by using a self-destruct mechanism on Menace's glider, which originally belonged to Osborn. After the battle which ended with the Venom symbiote badly injured, Osborn noticed Peter's camera, and re-engineered its homing device, allowing him to track Spider-Man's movement and location. He used this programming to form a special kind of tracer-bullets that only hits Spider-Man. He sent Bullseye and a group of Thunderbolts soldiers to capture the Wall Crawler but they failed.</p><p>Osborn also cured Gargan and his symbiote by building him a new special Scorpion suit armed with a very powerful poison able to kill Anti-Venom, derived from the villain Freak. When Spider-Man and Anti-Venom made their way to Oscorp, Gargan attacked and the poison proved to be effective against Anti-Venom, temporarily defeating him. As Spider-Man made his way to the main office, Osborn was now wearing his Green Goblin costume and ready to fight Spider-Man. A fight ensued with Spider-Man having the upper edge but stopped himself from finishing Norman off when the Goblin revealed that he had people hooked up to machines. As Spider-Man rushed to save those people, Osborn used the building's self-destruct mechanism. As the building crumbled, Spider-Man saved the people and Norman managed to escape. He was then seen giving a public speech and was still seen as a hero to the public.</p><h3><b>Secret Invasion</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-680553\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5444947209653\" data-width=\"663\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 663px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-680553\"><img alt=\"Fighting the Skrulls\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 663w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 621w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting the Skrulls\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 663w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 621w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/680553-usa.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting the Skrulls</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderbolt Mountain is being attacked by a Skrull <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a>, but was convinced by Osborn to leave.

Later on, a while Norman was in his limo, the roof was ripped off by webbing, and Osborn is captured by an enraged Spider-Man, who starts beating on Osborn all over the city, telling him to leave Harry alone but Osborn only expresses his disappointment for not seeing him snap. During the fight, Osborn answers his phone and to Spider-Man's shock, it's Harry who has reconsidered his father's offer. Norman then laughs in triumph as a frustrated Spider-Man leaves. However, it is revealed that Harry only accepted the offer because his girlfriend Lily Hollister, who is also the Menace, is pregnant, and Harry swore to do anything to provide what is necessary to his family. In front of the public, Norman welcomes Harry to the Dark Avengers and showed him his plans for him to use the American Son armor which can only be used by an Osborn. While Norman is showing Harry Stark Tower's many facilities, Spider-Man infiltrated the Tower, posing as Dark Spider-Man. Harry catches Spider-Man defeating Daken in the Tower and surprisingly, he tells Norman that it's not \"his\" Spider-Man instead of going along Spider-Man's bluff. Web-Head is shot in knees and captured by Bullseye.</p><p>Norman and Bullseye begin to mercilessly torture Spider-Man but still unable to remove his mask because it is made of unstable molecules. It is then revealed that Lily is pregnant with Norman's son and not Harry's. Norman was seeking a heir to his legacy in case Harry would not be worthy but because of the Goblin Formula, his children will suffer the same condition Gwen's children suffered from. So, he mated with Lily, who also had a Goblin Formula in her, which stabilizes the aging condition. Once Peter learned of this, he escaped Osborn's clutches and informed Harry the truth before collapsing. As Norman is beating on Spider-Man, an enraged Harry, using the American Son armor attack his father. After interference from both Spider-Man and Menace, Harry defeats his father, and just about he was going to finish him off, Spider-Man tells him that if he does kill him, he will be the son Norman always wanted so Harry leaves Norman battered and bloody.</p><p>Later on, Norman is seen with a pregnant Lily, telling his unborn child that Harry is failure and his \"little Goblin Prince\" will be much more worthy of the Goblin legacy.</p><h3>Utopia: No More X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-963942\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5066666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-963942\"><img alt=\"Iron Patriot Vs Cyclops\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Patriot Vs Cyclops\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/963942-850703_x_men_avengers_cover_super.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Patriot Vs Cyclops</figcaption></figure><p>After mutant riots break out in San Francisco, Norman Osborn turns his attention to the mutant \"problem\".

He then, after creating his own team of avengers, creates his own team of X-Men featuring <a href=\"/mimic/4005-12546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12546\">Mimic</a> as Angel, <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a> as Xavier, <a href=\"/dark-beast/4005-3422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3422\">Dark Beast</a> as Beast, Daken as Wolverine, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, and <a href=\"/michael-pointer/4005-7600/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7600\">Weapon Omega</a>, and <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a> and <a href=\"/dagger/4005-1935/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1935\">Dagger</a>, while being lead by Emma Frost. During an encounter between X-Force, and the Dark X-Men, Emma and Namor show their true colors by taking out Daken and Mimic. When Osborn hears news of this, he is outraged, and promises he will kill <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> himself. During an ensuing battle on a far away mutant island called Utopia, Osborn engages Cyclops, and easily takes him down. However, instead of eliminating Scott, he takes the time to taunt the X-Leader. Before Osborn can finally move in for the kill, he sees the Sentry fly into space being pursued by the Void, and <a href=\"/moonstar/4005-1463/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1463\">Moonstar</a> taking down Ares. He begins to panic while Moonstone tells him they need to kill the X-Men to escape. Unfortunately for Norman, there are too many of them and he is forced to fall back with his Avengers and X-Men. He is later seen on the news spinning his version of events. Osborn tells the world that his forces won the epic battle (though he is aware they clearly lost) and Utopia is declared a mutant prison. Norman has made a list of obstacles standing in his way and needs to be taken out.</p><h3>The List</h3><p>Clint Barton publicly outed Osborn as a villain, so he decided to take him out along with the rest of the New Avengers. However, not long after the events of Utopia, Clint Barton invaded Stark Tower in an attempt to assassinate Osborn. However, he failed because of Ares, who saved Osborn and placed Barton under arrest. Later on, Osborn had Barton tortured for information on the rest of the Avengers' location. Despite Clint refusing to co-operate, Osborn was still able to get the information he needed by using a telepath to enter his mind. Now knowing their location, Osborn sent a group of H.A.M.M.E.R agents to raid and destroy the Avengers' base, but none of them were there at the time. When Osborn and his Avengers were involved in the wrecking crew incident, he was able to arrest Luke Cage, and have him sent off into a H.A.M.M.E.R. prison/hospital since Cage suffered a heart attack. This facility was raided by the New Avengers, who ended up rescuing both Cage and Barton, infuriating Osborn.</p><p>During a public speech, <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> attempted to assassinate Osborn but failed thanks to the Sentry, who stopped the bullet at the last second, millimeters in front of Norman's eyes. Seeing the Punisher as a threat, Norman hired the Hood and his gang to take him out, but they failed. In the end, he sent Daken to finish off Frank once and for all, a task Daken violently succeeded in.</p><p>Osborn has saved the best for last. For his final item on the list, he wants to kill the Amazing Spider-Man. He captures Spider-Man downloading a video of Osborn conducting horrible experiments in Stark Tower. Iron Patriot and Spider-Man fight in the streets but Peter manages to escape and changed into civilian clothes and download the video on the internet. Osborn threatened to kill him but Parker stood up to him and told him off. Osborn left to trace the video.</p><p>Ever since Norman gained control, he had a secret weapon. This was played out for months and months, finally it was revealed that his secret weapon was the Sentry's alter-ego, the Void. Sentry returned to New York, in a state of insanity, Osborn pleaded with him to control the Void, which finally he did, and Norman also saw this as his opportunity to have even more power. During a meeting with The Cabal, as Doctor Doom states he is leaving because Osborn wants to kill his ally Namor, Osborn gives the order for the Void to kill Doom. Void ends up throwing Doom through a wall but it turned out to be a Doom Bot that sent many bug-like machines to terrorize Stark Tower and the Avengers. The Sentry also told Norman of his wife having knowledge of Sentry's true origin but he refused to tell him what she knew, so Osborn gave Bullseye orders to kill <a href=\"/lindy-reynolds/4005-13759/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13759\">Lindy Reynolds</a>. And he does by chocking her, and throwing her out of a helicopter.</p><h3>Siege</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088257\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5670910871694\" data-width=\"1021\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1021px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088257\"><img alt=\"The Attack on Asgard\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 1021w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 612w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Attack on Asgard\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 1021w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 612w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1088257-siege_1_7.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Attack on Asgard</figcaption></figure><p>One night, Osborn was talking to his Goblin side who convinced him to attack Asgard to achieve ultimate power, and though at first reluctant, Osborn agrees. In his final quest for power, Norman Osborn sees Asgard and wants to run it and since Loki made himself a member of the Cabal, he would be able to become the ruler of Asgard. After being denied permission by the President, Loki sends out members of the Hood's Gang to Chicago where <a href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\">Volstagg</a> is traveling to set up an incident (similar to the Stamford incident that sparked Civil War), thus giving him a reason to invade Asgard. The members engage Volstagg and end up blowing up Soldier Field, killing many civilians in the process. Osborn summons his Avengers as well as the entire Initiative to wage war against Asgard. Though the Avengers were unwilling at first, Norman tells them that if they join him, he will set them all free. His one problem is Ares. He is a descendant from Asgard and would never fight his brothers. Osborn lies and says Loki has gained control of Asgard, Ares agrees to go, but warns him that if he is lying, he will kill him. Asgard is caught off guard by Osborn's forces. Donald Blake is helping Tony Stark recuperate in a hospital while he sees fighter jets blanket the Oklahoma skies. He knows Osborn is out to destroy Asgard. He leaves and becomes Thor. Once Osborn sees Thor after him, he has a number of villains and The Sentry attack him and beat him mercilessly. This is watched by Steve Rodgers. As Norman's assault continues, Maria Hill launches a missile at him and seizes the opportunity to get Thor to safety in order for him to recover. As Ares is fighting, he realizes he was tricked, and goes after Norman.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227013\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2196531791908\" data-width=\"692\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 692px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227013\"><img alt=\"\"What's on his face?\" \"Crazy Sauce.\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" data-width=\"524\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg 692w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11635/1227013-siege_norman.jpg 524w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"What's on his face?\" \"Crazy Sauce.\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Sentry charges at him and the two battle, but the Sentry gains the upper hand, ripping Ares in half to the shock of everyone.

Later after Luke Cage is appointed the leader of the new team of Thunderbolts, Osborn is seen as a new prisoner on the <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">Raft</a>, a prison made specifically to hold some of the most dangerous villains in the world.</p><h3>Osborn Incarcerated</h3><p>The story starts at the <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">Raft</a> prison where <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> observes a spider in his cell and admires how it captures its prey. The authorities fear that Osborn might walk away free using a plea of insanity so to insure that the trial is executed carefully and without mistakes they keep Norman without charges and they transfer him to a privately operated facility called the <a href=\"/special-containment-center/4020-57162/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57162\">Special Containment Center (SCC)</a> that holds the world's most dangerous villains: <a href=\"/kingmaker/4005-41990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41990\">Kingmaker</a>, <a href=\"/xirdal/4005-74630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74630\">Xirdal</a>, Carl \"Carny\" Rives, <a href=\"/june-covington/4005-74558/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74558\">June Covington the Toxic Doxie</a>, and <a href=\"/the-decapitator/4005-74554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74554\">Ai Apaec the Decapitator</a>.

Norman is placed in the facility's Third Wing where Coulmier, in a fake private therapy session, tells Norman about the growing Goblin Cult as he believes that Norman has a crucial role in bringing about a better world and offers to break him out of the facility to lead their cult. Although Norman is intrigued by the proposition, he refuses because as a political prisoner, escaping would hurt his cause. As Coulmier continues to try and convince Norman to escape with him, an alarm goes off and Norman uses this opportunity to kill two guards and begin his escape. With the alarm still going off, Ai Apaec kills a guard and Norman confront him and the other inmates and tells them that he will free them all as long as they follow his orders until they are free and threatens that he will kill them all if they don't. However, one of the inmates, Xirdal, refuses to follow a murderer and goes on her own path, and she is seemingly killed by flooding waters after she opened a hatch. Osborn thinks that she made a poor choice and continues on his path with Coulmier and the other inmates.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Front Line offices, <a href=\"/norah-winters/4005-58731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58731\">Norah Winters</a>, after following the advice of Peter Parker, starts working on her paper concerning Norman Osborn since he's in jail but when one of her informants tell her that Norman has been removed from the Raft, she becomes afraid for her life, thinking that Norman will kill her if she publishes her paper so she decides to find his whereabouts. She receives a mysterious envelope from her informant telling her to meet him at Pier 84. There, he directs Norah to a submarine, taking her to the SCC.</p><p>Osborn and the remaining inmates of the Third Wing enter into the the main area of the prison, where a riot between the other prisoners is taking place. Here he quickly takes control of the rioters by targeting and taking out the strongest threat he can find. The rioters realize who he is and begin to chant his name while showing their <a href=\"/goblin-tattoo/4055-56590/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56590\">Goblin tattoos</a>. This is all observed by Norah Winters who has made her way to a guard post above the riot. Norman notices that someone is in the guard post and sends Ai Apaec to investigate. Upon seeing that it is Norah, he smiles and tells her that she is just in time to see him raise an army.</p><p>As that is going on, Sarah Saulsby, another reporter from the Daily Bugle is trying to track down Norah. She rings the police and says that she hasn't been able to contact her, and that she thinks it has something to with Norman Osborn and a meeting point on Pier 84. She says she has to get the message to Senator Sondra Muffoletto, who was mentioned in Norah notes. Once Sondra hears mention of Pier 84 she contacts Senator Morrison who denies any knowledge of anything to do with Osborn. Sondra realizes she is being set up to take the fall if the truth about Osborn comes out.</p><p>Norman then makes a speech about being the man of the people and that him and his fellow inmates were treated without a fair trial. Later, he questions Norah on how she got here and figured out that it was Senator Morrison's who is blackmailing Senator Muffoletto. Osborn then gets in touch with Muffoletto and tells her he will make all of this go away if she tells him how to escape. It turns out there is a submarine. While Norman sends his henchman to find the submarine, he has a talk with Father Coulmier about why exactly is he here. Coulmier explains that it's not because he worships him, but because he suspects him of being the anti-Christ. With that, Osborn gives him a task to complete while he escapes to the submarine. When he arrives, he is greeted by Carney Rives, the inmate with phasing abilities, and he was the one that brought Norah Winters down there. He uses his powers of intangibility to get Osborn, Norah, and the rest in the escape pod. Meanwhile Sen. Muffoletto than calls the pentagon notifying this issue, but before they can reach to the underwater prison, Coulmier, who was left behind, self-destructs the prison.</p><p>Thanks to The Decapitator ability, the submarine was able to survive the shockwave of the explosion. Three weeks after their escape, the group parted ways. Norman leaves out of a national bank and meets up with June Covington at a restaurant. Afterward, Osborn calls the police and turns himself in. When Norah hears that Osborn turned himself in, she quickly rushed over to the court to confront him before he's transferred back to the Raft. During their exchange, Osborn calls Norah a C-rated reporter and should quit.</p><p>Later, Senator Muffoletto visits Norman Osborn at the Raft. She asks why Osborn blew up the underwater prison. He replies that he was restoring the dignity of those incarcerated and that he was righteous, or in which Muffoletto sees it as mass murder by euthanasia. Afterward, she leaves and Osborn is greeted by his new doctor- June Covington.</p><h3>H.A.M.M.E.R.

Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are deactivated remotely by <a href=\"/spider-man-2099/4005-40524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40524\">Spider-Man 2099</a>, who confronts Otto about his true identity. Suddenly, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated by Goblin King, grabbing both Spider-Men by their heads. He then declares that Norman Osborn now runs the city. The Spider-Men continue to battle Osborn’s Spider-Slayers until he shows the Otto an image of Anna in captivity, causing him to snap. The Goblin King then offers Otto a free path out into the city, and he takes the bait, leaving Spider-Man 2099 stranded.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3766068\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.55435952637244\" data-width=\"1858\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1858px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3766068\"><img alt=\"The Real Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 1858w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Real Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 1858w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111115288/3766068-superiorspider-man31-p.15.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Real Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, Spider-Man shows up to confront the Goblin King, who proceeds to taunt him only for Spider-Man to banter bake, making him realize that the real Spider-Man is back. As they fight him, Spider-Man uses the Osborn's weapons to free Anna Maria. Gaining the upper hand, he prepared to inject the cure to the Goblin King, but he manages to fend it off. During the struggle Peter is able to remove his mask, revealing the face of Mason Banks. Norman Osborn reveals that after waking up from his coma, he had plastic surgery to change his face in order to become an Alchemax Executive and use the corporation to build an empire for his grandson, Normie. However, because his mask was removed, it allowed Parker to use Otto's Mini Spider-bots loaded with the Goblin Cure to inject him. As Osborn is delivered to the authorities, Liz Allan uses the Spider-Sense Jammer, allowing Osborn to escape underground. There Osborn begins to reflect on how, though, the Goblin Cure erased the effects of the Goblin Formula; it also healed him from his madness. Proclaiming that he had won, having secures an empire for his heir and that he will return with a vengeance, promising that \"they'll never see him coming\".</p><p> </p><h2>Powers</h2><p><b>Genius Intellect</b>- Even before exposing himself to the Goblin serum, Norman Osborn was highly intelligent, with expertise in a variety of scientific fields. Evidence of this is seen in his creation of Goblin formulas. However, after his dosage of the formula, his intelligence increased even further. Osborn has been able to engineer multiple chemical compounds and mixtures, most notably his diverse variations of the Goblin formula. The most recent of his chemical engineering include the shape-shifting Menace formula and the serum that modifies the Venom symbiote's appearance. Norman has also been able to engineer a number of different electronic and mechanical inventions, including the Green Goblin equipment, the Iron Patriot armor, and the American Son program. Norman's intellect has also been sufficient to strategize his continued formation and direction of multiple teams to further his agenda, such as the Dark Avengers, Dark X-Men, Thunderbolts, and Dark Illuminati.</p><p><b>Superhuman Strength</b>- Norman gained superhuman strength from the Goblin serum. His strength is sufficient for him to lift 9 tons under his own power, and he has thus been able to fight Spider-Man head to head on several occasions.</p><p><b>Superhuman Speed-</b> Osborn also possesses superhuman speed to complement his strength.</p><p><b>Superhuman Reflexes</b>- As Norman's speed has been augmented, he can also react at superhuman levels.</p><p><b>Superhuman Durability</b>- The Goblin formula also gave Norman the ability to withstand greater physical damage than a normal human being. Although he is far from invulnerable and can be injured by conventional firearms and bladed weapons, he has been able to withstand powerful impact forces. Osborn has been able to withstand blows from Spider-Man in combat multiple times.</p><p><b>Superhuman Stamina-</b> Norman can physically exert himself much longer than normal humans as his musculature produces significantly less fatigue toxins.</p><p><b>Accelerated Healing-</b> Osborn has a moderate healing factor that was sufficient to save him from death when he was impaled by his own glider. He has also been able to recover from other severe injuries, such as the detonation of several of his own bombs.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p><b>Green Goblin Suit-</b> Previously, Osborn utilized the Goblin suit. The tunic in the suit provided Norman some moderate protection from physical trauma.</p><p><b>Pumpkin Bombs</b>- The Green Goblin's trademark weapons were pumpkin bombs. As their name suggests, these bombs were designed with the appearance of Jack-O'-Lanterns. These varied in function, from smoke bombs to traditional explosives.</p><p><b>Razor Bats-</b> The Goblin also used bat-shaped, razor discs that could cut through very durable surfaces and materials.</p><p><b>Electricity Generation-</b> The gloves of the Green Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity of an undetermined voltage. Norman would use this as a deadly weapon against Spider-Man in their battles.</p><p><b>Flying Broomstick-</b> Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin.</p><p><b>Goblin Glider</b>- The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry other objects with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.</p><p><b>Iron Patriot Armor-</b> During his time as head of national security, Norman used a suit of armor similar to Tony Stark's Iron Man Armor. It is patterned in a manner similar to Captain America's uniform. The armor grants Osborn the ability to lift 100 tons, fly at high speeds, and fire repulsor beams, very similar to the Iron Man armor. However, because Norman lacks the experience that Stark has, he has not used it as efficiently, and the Iron Patriot armor may not have some of the numerous upgrades that the Iron Man armor does.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Aside from the above listed powers, Norman Osborn possesses great skills in manipulation as he has showcased over the years, most notably in Dark Reign. He often manages to bend others to his will or direct them in ways which benefit him in the long run. The value he places in others is directly related to his personal opinion of their usefulness. Evidence of this is found in his long running feud with Spider-Man, who he once considered a worthy heir to his legacy, and who he sees as a worthy nemesis. On the flip-side, an example of his ruthlessness is seen in how he used his son Harry.</p><p>Feigning the role of a supportive father, Norman offered Harry a place on the Dark Avengers team as the new incarnation of Captain America. Bringing him in to the American Son project, Norman reunited him with his pregnant ex-fiance Lilly Hollister (who became Menace after exposure to a new goblin formula). The reality is that Norman had stolen the affection of Harry's girlfriend, and impregnated Lilly to create a worthy heir. He further 'treated' Lilly, adjusting her goblin form into one that was much more attractive and similar to the Osborn Green Goblin persona. The ultimate plan was to sacrifice Harry in the field (similar to the death of Steve Rogers) after building him a public following. Norman destroyed his son's life and would murder him to get an increase in public sympathy and support.</p><p>Aside from his ability to manipulate others, Norman is a skilled combatant and is proficient in the use of a number of different forms of weaponry. Most notably, his own personally designed Goblin weapons, and glider.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><ul><li><b>Mental Instability</b>: Although a scientific genius, Osborn's mental condition is unstable. The Goblin formula greatly increased his intelligence but cost him his sanity, resulting in excessive arrogance and delusions of grandeur. Thus, it can lead him to make irrational decisions. His insanity worsened after the Gathering of the Five, making him lose more perspective on reality.</li><li><b>Pride</b>: Osborn's insanity has weakened his overall thought processes and views on reality. He believes that he cannot be defeated and often underestimates his opponents. An example of this is when Osborn captured Spider-Man, he revealed that he knew that Spider-Man was planning to escape. However, to prove his superiority, he decided to allow Spider-Man to escape so that Norman could fight him head to head. This ultimately resulted in Osborn's defeat.</li></ul><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5'11\"; 6'4\" (in armor)</li><li><b>Weight</b>: 185 lbs.; 385 lbs.

Instead of wearing a costume and mask like his classic incarnation, this version of Green Goblin is an actual horned, green-skinned beast with tremendous strength and pyrokinetic abilities.</p><p>After seemingly perishing during his first battle with Spider-Man, Norman later returns. He gains the ability to control his transformations into the Green Goblin via chemical injections, but also begins going insane as a result. This leads to multiple clashes with Spider-Man, and ends with Norman being taken into custody by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D. </a>and placed in cryonic suspension.</p><p>Norman later escapes once again, and battles Harry after he transforms into the Hobgoblin. The fight tragically ends with Harry's death, and Norman is horrified by what he's done. He reverts to his human form and asks <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers </a>to kill him, and she obliges by shooting him in the head.</p><p>After yet another escape, Norman recruits a group of villains to help him kill Peter Parker, now believing that God does not want Peter to live. In the resulting power, both Norman and Peter are apparently killed, with the the fight witnessed by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/miles-morales/4005-79420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79420\">Miles Morales</a>. The guilt over his inaction later spurs Miles to carry on Peter's legacy by becoming the new Spider-Man.</p><p>Norman is later revealed to have survived his \"death\", as the OZ formula in his blood has given him powerful regenerative abilities, effectively making him immortal. He escapes from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where he had been held captive, and battles Miles. With help from Peter Parker (who like Norman, also survived thanks to OZ), Miles is able to defeat Norman.</p><h4>Earth 295: Age of Apocalypse</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930314\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg\" data-ratio=\"5.234375\" data-width=\"64\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 64px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:523.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1930314\"><img alt=\"AoA\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px\" data-width=\"64\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg 64w\"><noscript><img alt=\"AoA\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5774/1930314-red.jpg 64w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px\" data-width=\"64\"></noscript></a><figcaption>AoA</figcaption></figure><p>Osborn was a member of the <a href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauders</a> (Human Terrorist enhanced by Apocalypse), along with teammates <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a>, <a href=\"/owl/4005-13908/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13908\">Owl</a>, and Red (this universe's version of <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>).

Unlike other animated incarnations, the GG bears more of a physical appearance to the Ult Green Goblin, and is at first savage and unintelligent. He soon manages to break control from Doctor Octopus' control, and easily beats Peter and his friends, though Peter puts up a sustained fight. He later appears, regaining his intelligence, and using his iconic glider. He tries to get Harry Osborn to accept the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom Symbiote</a>.

Unlike his comic counterpart, he legitimately seeks to make amends for his actions by becoming the Iron Patriot, until Doctor Octopus forcibly transforms him back into the Green Goblin. After Spider-Man saves him again and once again helps turn him back into a normal human, Norman more or less becomes one of his allies. During the series finale, Norman plays a key role in restoring Spider-Man's powers after Doctor Octopus neutralizes them with a special serum. It's also revealed that Norman has known Spider-Man is Peter Parker for some time, but kept the information secret out of gratitude.</p><h4>Marvel Future Avengers</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437434\" data-ratio=\"0.554\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437434\"><img alt=\"Green Goblin in the Future Avengers anime\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 500w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Green Goblin in the Future Avengers anime\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 500w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437434-goblin%20anime.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Green Goblin in the Future Avengers anime</figcaption></figure><p>Norman Osborn appears in the <em>Marvel Future Avengers</em> episodes \"Rampaging Hulk,\" \"Spider-Man to the Rescue,\" and \"Green Goblin vs. The Hulk,\" with Norman voiced by Hiroshi Yanaka in the Japanese version and by Dave Wittenberg in the English dub. </p><p>He is first seen as the Green Goblin, battling the seemingly out of control Hulk.

2018 <em>Spider-Man</em> game, voiced by Mark Rolston. He is once again the head of Oscorp and the father of Harry Osborn. Within the game's backstory, Norman was once the close friend and lab partner of Otto Octavius, with whom he founded Oscorp. After meeting and falling in love with a lawyer named Emily, Norman developed an obsession with genetics, seemingly due to his wife's illness. At some point in the 1980s, Norman began development of an experimental serum called GR-27, nicknamed \"Devil's Breath,\" which was tested on a young boy named Martin Li. The disastrous experiment killed Martin's parents and gave the boy superpowers, which led to Otto leaving Oscorp and ending his friendship with Norman in protest.</p><p>In the present day, Martin, now the supervillain <a href=\"/mister-negative/4005-49969/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49969\">Mister Negative</a>, sets out to get revenge against Norman for causing the death of his parents. Octavius later attempts to gain his own vengeance after becoming Doctor Octopus, releasing Devil's Breath on the city to cause a pandemic. In the game's epilogue, it is revealed that Norman has secretly been performing experimental treatments on Harry, who inherited the same illness that killed Emily. These treatments apparently involve the Venom symbiote.</p><h4>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7305060\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7305060\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Alliance 3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Alliance 3\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7305060-goblin%20alliance.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Alliance 3</figcaption></figure><p>Green Goblin appears as a boss character in the third <em>Ultimate Alliance</em> game, with <a href=\"/steven-blum/4040-69073/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69073\">Steve Blum</a> reprising his role from the <em>Spectacular Spider-Man</em> animated series.

When Odin saw Loki as a baby, he adopted him - This began a prophecy foretold by Odin's father, <a href=\"/bor/4005-58894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58894\">Bor</a>.</p><p><b>Childhood</b></p><p>Loki was not like his brother <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, He proved to be a mischievous child, and was often also jealous of the affection Odin showed his older brother <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>. He began studying <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgardian</a> magic and science, both of which he would become very proficient in, eventually becoming one of the strongest sorcerers in the Asgard. Loki is well known for cutting off the long, golden hair of Thor's love, <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a>. He was forced by Thor to restore it. Loki then enlisted two dwarves to do so, but when he refused to pay them, they made new, black hair, out of nothing.</p><p>In his youth, Loki tried again and again to gain advantage over his older brother Thor. Odin sent Thor, <a href=\"/balder/4005-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\">Balder</a>, and Sif out in search of materials for a sword. Loki followed them secretly, but found that an evil goddess was about to attack, and was forced to alert them instead of stopping them. Meanwhile, Odin loved Thor so much that he was preparing his greatest gift to the young Thor. When Thor turned eight, Odin had a magical hammer created, an amazingly powerful one - <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>. Loki was jealous, and he showed his first signs of evil. He interfered with Mjolnir while it was still being made-he caused the handle to be made too short. As a boy, he wanted Mjolnir's power which would someday be Thor's and often tried to steal it.</p><p>This all had an effect on Loki. He grew angrier with each passing day, he was truly becoming evil. His hate for Thor and desire to rule <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> manifested along with his sorcery and mischief. He became jaded and evil. He finally made a vow-to be the most powerful god in Asgard, and to kill his brother Thor.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Based on some Norse myths, Loki appeared for the first time in <a href=\"/venus/4050-18698/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18698\">Venus</a> #6.

Most notably the Avengers, although he's fought many others. However Loki was an enemy of Thor and goodness before he entered the Marvel Universe and became known. Thor and Loki grew up, and Thor gained the throne of Asgard. Loki became a public enemy. He often tried to seize the throne of Asgard and perpetrated numerous crimes. Eventually, his crimes grew so great that Odin himself was forced to take drastic action. He trapped Loki inside a tree as punishment for his crimes. Loki, however was very skilled in magic and escaped.</p><p>Disgruntled, he wandered until finding Eldred, a sorcerer. Eldred was amazingly skilled and powerful in magic, and he specialized in black magic. Eldred schooled Loki in the black arts until Loki was as skilled as he. Loki left with his new found abilities and found someone who could enhance his power even more - <a href=\"../../surtur/29-10967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Surtur</a> the fire demon. He had power beyond power-and he had a particular liking for souls. Loki turned on his teacher Elfred. He sold Eldred's soul to Surtur for power, and in return assumed even more power, all of Eldred's lands, minions, and possessions.</p><p>Loki continued committing acts such as this for a long time. He drew further into black magic, and earned the title \"God of Evil\" among the Asgardians. He also formed alliances with many of the worst creatures in Asgard, horrible creatures. Angerboda was an evil goddess who became Loki's wife. Their children were the <a href=\"../../midgard-serpent/29-14471/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midgard Serpent</a>, <a href=\"../../fenris-wolf/29-41946/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fenris Wolf</a>, and <a href=\"../../hela/29-4342/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hela</a> (later Goddess of Death and enemy of Thor). Loki also married <a href=\"../../sigyn/29-13478/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sigyn</a> by tricking her into believing he was Theoric, her lover.</p><p>Also, an important development happened at this time. Loki learned of a prophecy-Ragnarok. In Ragnarok, it was fated that he would bring about Asgard's ruin. He would lead the enemies of Asgard into a war against Asgard, kill Balder, and destroy all of Asgard. Loki, being evil, liked the idea, and accepted it as his destiny. He often tried to destroy Asgard and bring about Ragnarok, but Odin continually stopped him. However, Loki's schemes were so crafty that no one could ever prove it was him. Meanwhile, his brother Thor had became arrogant. The worship of Midgard, and adulation of Asgardians as their king went to his head. He also became proud and selfish. One day, while fighting a Frost Giant, he chased it into Frost Giant territory. This nearly caused a war. Odin was so angry that he decided to punish Thor. He created a mortal body for Thor, Donald Blake, stripped Thor of his powers and memories, and trapped him inside the body of Donald Blake, M.D.</p><h3>Ages of Thunder</h3><p>Asgard was under attack by the Frost Giants. All the gods were fighting as if it was the end of Asgard. In the end it was Thor standing strong along with his lightning winning the battle for Asgard. Thor brought down a mighty giant who fell and destroyed a giant wall of Asgard which had stood for as long as anyone could remember. The wall was ruined but it was spring once again. Yggdrasil grew golden apples once again for the Asgardians to feast on. Only Enchantress had the power to pick the apples from the great tree. All of the gods gained wisdom and youth from eating these apples in their meals. All that is, except for the mighty Thor. Heimdall then spots a man walking towards Asgard. The man was a mason who offered Odin his services to fix the great wall which had been destroyed in their war against the Frost Giants. The mason said he'd be able to fix the wall in a year if he could have one thing. He wanted neither riches nor power, all he wanted was the Enchantress herself. Loki talked with Odin and they decided to accept the masons offer to rebuild their wall. However, they told him that he'd have six months and not a year to do so. They all agreed, as the gods deemed it as an impossible task for the man. However, the man built at an alarming rate, a rate that would finish the wall in less than six months. This greatly angered Odin and he told Loki to fix their problem or else he'd bind him to stone forever. Loki then shapeshifted into a mare in order to distract the man's steed. All night, Loki distracted the steed and in the morning, the man wasn't able to finish the wall. Odin told the man that he couldn't complete the task, but the man knew that it was Loki who distracted his steed and who made him fail in his task. The man began to say that he'd kill them all and showed his true form. He was actually a shapeshifting Frost Giant who was ready to damn the Asgardians. As he fought Loki and Odin, Thor returned from his recent journey and killed the Giant by throwing Mjolnir at him. He then ordered Loki to clean up his mess. Thor then walked through Asgard, carrying with him the heads of several Frost Giants.</p><p>Loki was then banished from Asgard for yet another attempt of trickery. Loki wandered though Asgard with no food or direction. It seemed as if he'd been traveling in the snow for thousands of years. One day, an eagle flew up to him and started asking him questions. The eagle laughed at Loki, seeing how weak and desperate he was. The eagle offered Loki a deal. He'd give him food if he could bring him his hearts desire, the Enchantress. Loki then talked to Enchantress and fooled her by saying he had found golden apples which she could pick. They climbed to the top of a snowy mountain where a Frost Giant, who had masqueraded as the eagle, was waiting for them. The Giant then took Enchantress with him to be his queen. The Asgardians then began to starve as only Enchantress was able to pick the golden apples from the tree. Odin then found out that Loki was to blame and forced him to attempt to save Enchantress from the Frost Giant. Loki then went back to the lair of the Frost Giant. He found Enchantress laying there tied up while the Frost giant was sleeping. He secreted her and then the Frost Giant woke up discovered her missing. The Frost Giant gave chase and eventually caught up to the two Asgardians and took hold of them. There was nobody around to rescue the two from the hands of the Frost Giant. yet when all seemed lost, Thor then came flying down from the sky straight into the Frost Giant, killing him. Enchantress was then returned to Asgard and the gods could all feast on the Golden Apples once more.</p><h3>Avengers Creation</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212811\" data-ratio=\"1.4350877192982\" data-width=\"570\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212811\"><img alt=\"Loki and the Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg 570w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki and the Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg 570w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27002/1212811-mignola_avengers_by_tmd2008.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki and the Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Donald Blake was a happy normal doctor. He was caring and loving and had a good family. Then the alien Kronans invaded. Fleeing, Blake fled into the cave Thor was born in. He found a walking stick, and when he picked it up, it became Mjolnir. He transformed into Thor and regained his memories. This meant he could change into Thor whenever he wanted by banging his cane on the ground. So, Thor was back on Earth and eventually Loki found out. Naturally, this was big news for the evil god-his long lost, worst enemy brother was, at last, found. Loki used powerful magic and managed to escape his own imprisonment and end up on an island. There, Loki made his first, most notable appearance.</p><p>Loki traveled to Earth, and found an incredible engine of destruction equal to Thor- the Incredible <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>. He used psychic powers to make the slow-minded Hulk believe there had been dynamite placed on the train tracks. Hulk destroyed the train trestle to stop the train from triggering the \"dynamite\" from exploding, and held the track on his shoulders so that the train could pass safely. However, what the train conductor saw was a broken track and Hulk beneath it. Naturally, he concluded that Hulk was on a rampage. He put out a distress call to alert authorities to the Hulk's seeming rampage. Loki intercepted the call and stopped it from reaching the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> and other heroes. The only one he let the transmission reach was Donald Blake, who instantly transformed into Thor, but <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ant-Man</a>, and <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a> also picked up the signal. Ant-Man used his network of ants to find Hulk. Hulk had been captured and was working in a circus as the strongman. Ant-Man quickly found him and had his ants trap Hulk beneath earth. Hulk escaped though, and was met by Iron Man. Iron Man and Ant-Man teamed up to confront Hulk, but he smashed his way through all their efforts and escaped into the desert.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thor suspected that this looked like the work of Loki. He was granted permission by Odin and traveled to the Asgardian island that Loki was located. Loki created many challenges for him along the way, such as volcanoes and more, but Thor overcame them all. Then they finally meet, for the first time in centuries. Loki created conjurations that Thor battled, but he defeated them. However, Loki had a trick up his sleeve. He made a deal with Trolls that lived beneath the surface-he would deliver unto them the most powerful god if they could but capture him. The trolls dragged Thor underground-but he used Mjolnir to shine a brilliant light on them. The underground creatures were blinded. Thor then defeated Loki in combat, captured him, and brought him to Earth.</p><p>Meanwhile, Iron Man and Hulk had been battling ferociously in a factory. As they battled, Thor showed up with Loki as his prisoner. He explained to the Hulk that it was really Loki's tricks on him that started the whole incident. Hulk then attacked Loki, but Loki turned radioactive. Loki then tried to destroy Thor but fell through a trap door, which trapped him inside a lead lined tank. The five heroes celebrated, and decided to form a team. Wasp suggested the name \"Avengers\". And thus, the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> were born-all due to Loki. The Avengers would become Loki's second greatest enemy-right behind Thor. They also became known as Earth's Greatest Heroes. Ironically, it was Loki's attack which would unwittingly create what would become a great force against evil, which included him so very often.</p><h3>Battles and Usurpings</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-109549\" data-ratio=\"1.4275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-109549\"><img alt=\"Hela - Daughter of Loki\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hela - Daughter of Loki\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/109549-113984-hela.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hela - Daughter of Loki</figcaption></figure><p>Loki continued to battle Thor, both by himself and using pawns. Loki was responsible for the creation of many of the powerful villains who fought Thor, the Avengers, and other heroes. Among those he used as pawns were <a href=\"../../absorbing-man/29-1779/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Absorbing Man</a>, <a href=\"../../destroyer/29-7940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destroyer</a>, <a href=\"../../cobra/29-11895/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra</a>, <a href=\"../../enchantress/29-7225/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enchantress</a> and <a href=\"../../executioner/29-3517/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Executioner</a>, <a href=\"../../lava-men/29-13818/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lava Men</a>, <a href=\"../../super-skrull/29-21332/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Skrull</a>, <a href=\"../../mr-hyde/29-3233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Hyde</a>, <a href=\"../../weather-maker/29-13596/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather-Maker</a>, and Surtur. These villains fought the Avengers and Thor, and were extremely successful. Enchantress and Executioner in particular were among the most dangerous enemies of the Avengers for a very long time.</p><p>Loki plotted another huge attack against Asgard in furtherance of his plans to attain his ultimate goal, ruler-ship. Odin ruled Asgard and was so powerful that Loki knew he would never be able to defeat him to become its new ruler, though rest assured, Loki tried. Odin had to sleep (or hibernate) in the Odinsleep for a time periodically to \"recharge\" his immense power. Loki tried to gain the throne of Asgard during one of these \"Odinsleeps\", while Odin's guard was down. He was actually successful. He gained control of the throne of Asgard. However, he ran into a problems. Asgard had a number of powerful dangerous enemies. It took a lot of skill, willpower, and wisdom to be a successful ruler, Loki realized then that ruling Asgard was harder then it looked. Mangog and Surtur, who were angry at the God of Mischief, caused numerous problems, and scared Loki so much that he eventually stepped down.</p><p>Loki also made several other evil bids to destroy his enemies and gain power during this time. He teamed up with <a href=\"../../dormammu/29-2205/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dormammu</a>, the insane and powerful ruler of the Dark Dimension, to try and gain the Evil Eye. The Evil Eye is a mystical, powerful object which would give him power beyond his wildest dreams (like <a href=\"../../red-skull/29-2250/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skull</a> and the <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube</a>). Ironically, he was tricking the Avengers and another team, the <a href=\"../../defenders/65-26333/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Defenders</a>, into building it for him. However, unlike Red Skull and the Cosmic Cube incident, Loki failed. He also launched a direct attack on Midgard, but he was stopped by Thor and a team of heroes which stopped him and the Asgardian army.</p><p>Finally, Loki stole the throne of Asgard again and was defeated. Odin became extremely angry at this latest attempt. He stripped Loki of his memories, created a human body, that of a hobo, put his consciousness into it, and transported him to Earth. Loki lived that way for a while until he was saved by a journalist named Harris Hobbs. Hobbs had been to Asgard but Thor wiped his memories of the visit. A dream restored his memories; the dream somehow reached Loki and restored his memories also. Angry by what had been done to him by Odin, Loki managed to cause Ragnarok by killing Balder with an arrow, but Balder was revived. Loki also gave a mortal the same powers as Thor so he could be an assistant. The mortal was Red Norvell. Loki was punished, but blamed Odin and was released from punishment.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-88915\" data-ratio=\"1.8103448275862\" data-width=\"232\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 232px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:181.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-88915\"><img alt=\"Loki's Tri-Sentinel!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" data-width=\"232\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG 232w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki's Tri-Sentinel!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/787/88915-141317-tri-sentinel.JPG 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" data-width=\"232\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki's Tri-Sentinel!</figcaption></figure><p>At one time, Hela cursed Thor. He would be immortal but would never heal from injuries. Loki found out and was pleased with Hela, who was doing a better job of killing Thor then he himself had ever done. He sent the Destroyer, an army of frost giants, and the Midgard Serpent to attack Thor. Thor got reduced to a puddle of broken bones, blood, and assorted crushed organs. However, he was still alive due to his immortality. Thor then mentally took over the Destroyer armor, found Hela, defeated her, then forced her to remove the curse. Thor broke Loki's arm as punishment.</p><p>Once, <a href=\"../../seth/29-12718/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seth</a> and the Demons of Death attacked Asgard. In a horrible war, Seth managed to capture Odin and keep him prisoner inside the source of Seth's power-the magical Black Pyramid. Loki and Thor teamed up and rescued Odin, who then inflicted his wrath upon Seth. This is one of the few rare times Loki has worked together with Thor. On Another occasion, Loki concocted a vast plot to rule the Earth and destroy the Avengers.

This particular appearance would have him appear as a businessman, trapped by Mephisto, fighting Thor and <a href=\"../../eric-masterson/29-29920/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Masterson</a>, and possessing none other then the <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">War Machine</a>. First, Loki created his plot-then he took the form of a businessman on Midgard and found Ulik, a troll, Amora the Enchantress, and the <a href=\"../../wrecking-crew/65-18519/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wrecking Crew</a>. Loki had them capture <a href=\"../../kevin-masterson/29-10230/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kevin Masterson</a>, the son of Eric Masterson. Thor, at this time, was bound into Eric Masterson's body. Thor was angry at Loki, and even in a human body, he managed to set Kevin free for Eric. As he was escaping, Loki launched a power blast at Kevin and Marcy, his mother-in petty spite.</p><p>The Enchantress though had secretly turned against Loki. She took control of the body of another mortal, Susan Austin-Kevin's babysitter. In Austin's body, she took the blast meant for Marcy, transferring her consciousness out of Susan Austin's body at the last second. This attack really angered Thor-Loki was trying to kill innocent mortals for no reason at all, just to spite Thor. The wrath of the God of Thunder truly fell upon the now terrified Loki. Thor drained the life force from Loki with Mjolnir and appeared to have killed him. As punishment, Thor was banished to Eric's subconscious as punishment by Odin. Eric became the new Thor, although he took the name <a href=\"../../thunderstrike/29-7611/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunderstrike</a> instead. On a side note, Thunderstrike was granted his own short series in the early 90s.</p><p>Meanwhile, Loki had taken over the body of Odin while he was in Odinsleep. He explored his new amazing powers, got a good laugh at Thor, then took control of Asgard. Odin's spirit floated down into the Realm of Mephisto, which was quite the bounty for it's new ruler, Mephisto. The souls of the innocent were fine, but the soul of the King of the Asgardians was even better. Fortunately, Thunderstrike and Thor's old buddy Sif traveled to Mephisto's Realm and rescued Odin, restoring him to his body. Mephisto simply took Loki in Odin's stead. Loki made a deal with <a href=\"../../pluto/29-2636/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pluto</a>, an evil underworld god of Hades. Loki would try to take down Hercules if Pluto would take down Thor. Mephisto was busy at the time and wasn't paying attention to Loki, not a good thing to do, even if you own his soul.</p><p>Loki tried having a Titan attack Hercules, but it failed. So he had the Flame, a high-level minion, attack Thor. However, the psychotic Flame almost hurt Sigyn, and Loki ended up having to save Thor from his own henchman. Loki was still trapped in Mephisto's Realm, but Thor eventually rescued him to help him fight the New Immortals, Loki's soul bonded to a suit of armor -- his body being long gone. Afterwards, Loki continued to fight Thor and now Thunderstrike. He even possessed the <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">War Machine</a> to fight them, and gained a new body from Seth afterwards. But then War Machine, the new Ant-Man ( <a href=\"../../scott-lang/29-20577/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott Lang</a>), and <a href=\"../../she-hulk/29-1449/\" rel=\"nofollow\">She-Hulk</a> teamed up against him, reminding him of the Avengers- he had more then enough trouble with the Avengers, and so he ended the fight.</p><h3>Infinity Gems</h3><p>Loki had a plan to capture ultimate power-with the <a href=\"../../infinity-gems/18-41041/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinity Gems</a>. The Infinity Gems were a collection of powerful gems-seven in all, each a different color, each with different powers. It was known that if anyone were to ever manage to collect all seven Infinity Gems, they would possess ultimate power-total omnipotence. <a href=\"../../thanos/29-7607/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thanos</a> and Red Skull had both tried and failed to capture them (although Red Skull got the Cosmic Cube later on).</p><p>Loki found that all of the Infinity Gems were floating in an alternate dimension-the Ultraverse. He traveled to this other reality to capture the Gems. They were already owned by the Ultras-a race of ultra powerful superhumans native to the Ultraverse. Each one had a gem, and each was incredibly powerful. Loki traveled throughout the Ultraverse and met the one's who possessed each gem, and easily destroyed them, one by one. They were no match for the God of Mischief. He attained six of the gems-but then realized that something was missing. Loki hadn't understood the true meaning of the Gems. He didn't know he would need a seventh. He searched throughout the Ultraverse for a long time, searching until one of the <a href=\"../../elders-of-the-universe/65-41142/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elders of the Universe</a>- <a href=\"../../grandmaster/29-32735/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grandmaster</a>-appeared to him and informed him that he needed another Gem-the Ego Gem. Loki, the Avengers, and <a href=\"../../ultraforce/49-18422/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultraforce</a> (the heroes of that dimension) all fought for the Gem. However, Loki couldn't defeat both Ultraforce and the Avengers. He never got the Gem, and eventually lost all of them-the closest Loki had come to true omnipotence. Humiliated, he returned to his own dimension-and he was angry ...</p><h3>Ragnarok</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85167\" data-ratio=\"1.51\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-85167\"><img alt=\"The Asgardian gods during Ragnarok\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Asgardian gods during Ragnarok\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/85167-49286-asgardian-gods.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Asgardian gods during Ragnarok</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Loki continued in his efforts to bring about Ragnarok. Loki has unceasingly continued to create and carry out plots to bring forth Ragnorok so as to destroy Asgard. However, through the efforts of Odin and Thor, he had so far been thwarted at every turn. After the Infinity Gems debacle, Loki started trying even harder, and Odin sensed that Ragnarok was going to come soon. In an attempt to try and increase the time they had, Odin tricked Yggdrasil, the World Tree, into thinking that Ragnarok had already happened, which resulted in all the Asgardians being stripped of their memories and Asgardian identities, given mortal identities, and placed on Midgard. Loki became an Oriental businessman named Tso Zhung. Thor became Jake Olsen, a paramedic. Afterwards, Red Norvell found all the Asgardians and brought them together, giving them back their true identities. Loki regained his identity first and fought Seth, who had tried to destroy all Asgardians given this unique opportunity. Eventually, all of the Asgardians regained their identities.</p><p>However, Jake Olsen (the real one) was killed, Thor then used the name and appearance of Jake Olsen as a secret identity. Loki reanimated the Jake Olsen's dead body and used it to commit crimes so Thor would be arrested, but Thor trapped Loki in a body exactly the same as Jake Olsen's. Loki was sent to prison.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266083\" data-ratio=\"1.5904572564612\" data-width=\"503\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 503px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266083\"><img alt=\"Rune King Thor beheading Loki\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg 503w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rune King Thor beheading Loki\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg 503w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266083-1241588_thorltloki_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rune King Thor beheading Loki</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately for him, Loki was eventually released from prison-just as Surtur actually managed to kill Odin. Thor took the throne, and things temporarily worked out for Loki-he got more power, and saw how Thor put Asgardian pieces of culture on Earth. But he was still evil, and he still believed in his destiny. And he knew what his destiny was - Ragnarok.</p><p>Loki forged another uru hammer similar to Mjolnir that he could use himself. He conceived of yet another plan to attempt to begin Ragnarok and destroy Asgard. Thor could have stopped him-he always had in the past. But he realized that the greatest possible honor on Asgard was to die fighting as a warrior. Asgard was on a loop, Loki attacks, Thor saves, death, rebirth. Thor accepted the destiny that Loki would eventually destroy Asgard and start Ragnarok-and he could thus ensure that everyone in Asgard wold die a warrior's death.</p><p>Thor though promised himself a caveat, if he was going to allow a whole dimension to die, he might as well get revenge on his greatest enemy, who had plagued him so much. With a swift stroke of Mjolnir, Thor hacked Loki's head off. Of course, Loki was an amazingly powerful sorcerer, and decapitation didn't kill him. His head still lived, so Thor carried it with him when he traveled to Asgard. Surtur was preparing to unleash an amazing assault on Asgard-one that would destroy it unless Thor stopped it. He let Surtur launch the attack-and Asgard was destroyed. But before Thor died, he confronted Those Who Sit Above In Shadow. The powers responsible for Ragnaroks, and he destroyed them. Then Asgard died-and Thor with it.</p><p>As for Loki, what could he do? Thor had decapitated him. All he could do was sit and watch as his ultimate goal-Ragnarok-was carried forth-and then scream as he also was vanquished in the attack. The last act of Loki, his last act in a long, sad and troubled life...a scream.. But even if his last act was to scream as his greatest plan destroyed him, Loki was still quite possibly the greatest threat ever to Thor and Asgard-and even in death, in the end-Loki won, as he was destined to...</p><h3>Rebirth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263987\" data-ratio=\"1.6919642857143\" data-width=\"224\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 224px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:169.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263987\"><img alt=\"Loki reborn and possessing Sif's Body\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" data-width=\"224\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg 224w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki reborn and possessing Sif's Body\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7963/263987-112081-loki.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" data-width=\"224\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki reborn and possessing Sif's Body</figcaption></figure><p>Like all the \"dead\" Asgardians, Loki was reborn in human form and imprisoned by Balder to prevent Thor from restoring Asgard. However the fates had a little surprise for Loki, as he was reborn as a female, inhabiting the body of Sif, Thor's true love. Loki has seemingly devoted herself to aiding her brother and former enemy in his quest to restore Asgard, but knowing Loki, this is undoubtedly a plan she has set into motion to destroy her brother once again. Due to Loki's latest moves Lady Sif remains as the last Aesir still trapped in human form. Balder discovered that he is a true son of Odin and not just adopted. Balder was then crowned Prince of Asgard. In contrast to Loki's life as a male god, the goddess seems to use hidden truths to spin her sinister webs rather then lies.</p><p>Loki sought out Hela to ask a favor. She wanted to be transformed back to her true male form as she was on a mission. Hela then transformed her into Loki's original form. Loki then revealed that the body he was using was the body of Sif. Loki was sent back in time to when the Asgardians were fighting the frost giants. Loki was attacked and slayed a frost giant. Their leader sensed their blood flowing through Loki's veins and knew he was one of them. Bor was seen chasing a frost giant and there was a powerful sorcerer. The powerful sorcerer that killed Bor was none other than Loki. He bid Bor farewell and transformed him into snow. Loki then influenced himself as a child to take revenge on his true father and to be tough. Loki's father was killed by the hands of Odin and young Loki appeared at the scene. He attacked Odin but was stopped and Odin took the young Loki to be his own son. After they left, the current Loki arrived and took satisfaction in striking down his father with a sword. Loki returned to Hela and asked to be transformed back to her form in the body of Sif.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266094\" data-ratio=\"1.4128571428571\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2266094\"><img alt=\"Loki with the Cabal\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 679w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki with the Cabal\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 679w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2266094-21399.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki with the Cabal</figcaption></figure><p>Loki has joined Norman Osborn's secret <a href=\"/cabal/4060-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56051\">Cabal</a>.

He distorts Bor's vision so that the world around him looks more deformed and grotesque. Unaware of who they were fighting, Thor and Bor battle each other until Bor falls dead under the might of Thor's hammer. Balder and Loki then appear and inform Thor that he has just killed his grandfather. Loki then reminds Balder that the laws of Asgard must be maintained, Thor must receive the full punishment for killing a member of the royal family. As prince of Asgard, Balder is forced to banish Thor from Asgard forever. Speaking to some Asgardians at a pub Loki informs them that there is another place were Asgard could dwell, in the land called Latveria, ruled by Victor Von Doom.</p><p>Loki plans on moving the Asgardians to Latveria now that Thor is banished. Loki and Balder meet with Dr. Doom at his castle in Latveria to discuss moving there. The two Asgardians are fed by Doom's slaves and Balder starts to question him on why his slaves look malnourished as he is still cautious in trusting Doom and Loki. They then discuss moving the inhabitants of Asgard to Latveria. Finally it was decided that the Asgardians who wish to move to Latveria, shall arrive via a portal made by Loki herself. Some Asgardians stay, but most follow Loki and Balder to live in Latveria under Doom.</p><p>Loki and Doom meet in the new home of the Asgardians, Latveria. Loki is now back in his male form as Thor was able to separate Sif from the body of an old dying woman. Loki tells Doom that the Asgardians love Latveria as it is much like Asgard to include the weather, structures and living under a Monarchy. Loki says everyone else is happy, then Doom asks him if he's happy, Loki then says with a grin that his happiness is just beginning.</p><p>Dr. Doom and Loki continue to discuss their plans. Doom gives Loki a small army of Doombots to help him kill his target, who is later revealed to be Donald Blake. Loki then goes off to prepare his own gift for Doom. Loki talks to an Asgardian named Endrik. Endrik shows Loki his sword and he tells him that he plans on giving it to his son one day, even though he doesn't have a son or a woman of his own. Loki asks Endrik to come with him and then puts a spell on Endrik which puts him to sleep.</p><p>Bill goes off to talk to Balder and on his way to him, he hears a scream. He looks at what is happening in the room and he overhears the plan of Loki and Doom. Loki used Endrik as a sacrifice for Doom so that he could try to use his organs to make himself immortal just like the Asgardians. Loki then spots Bill as he was watching them talk about their plans. He then sends three rogue Asgardians after him. Bill tries to fight them off, but he is stabbed in the gut by one of the superior Asgardian warriors.</p><h3>Underworld Deals and the Siege on Asgard</h3><p>Loki captured the spirits of his deceased minions killed by Balder in self-defense.

For this little gift Hela had stricken him of the books of Hel, by doing so she made him the only really immortal Asgardian. It is difficult to say whether or not he has become immune to harm or simply will not pass on of old age. Loki was recently exiled from Asgard by lord Balder because of his actions in Latveria and his involvement in the Siege on Asgard.</p><p>The horned master of mischief and mayhem was last seen when he attacked the mad Sentry/Void above the remains of the city of Asgard, this action could be a way of faking his own death. His seemingly last words were: \"I'm sorry, brother.\" Considering the deal he struck with Hel it is reasonable to believe that he has not passed on.</p><h3>Resurrection</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666736\" data-ratio=\"1.2708333333333\" data-width=\"624\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 624px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1666736\"><img alt=\"Loki resurrected as a boy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-width=\"503\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 503w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki resurrected as a boy\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/30334/1666736-mu7426.jpg 503w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-width=\"503\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki resurrected as a boy</figcaption></figure><p>After the events of Siege, Thor mourns Loki's death and decides to resurrect his brother. Loki is given new life as a Parisian street hustler named Serrure (the French word for lock), having no idea of who he was or how he came to be. Instead Serrure feigns simple card tricks in front of an audience while an accomplice pickpockets them. Thor confronts Loki in his new form while Serrure's accomplice robs the god of thunder in civilian guise. But Thor catches the thieves in the act and chases Serrure down until he can convince the boy of his true nature and identity as the Asgardian god of mischief. Thor brings Loki home to the fallen Asgard just as refugees of the World Tree arrive fleeing the genocidal rampage of <a href=\"/uthana-thoth/4005-73501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73501\">Uthana-Thoth</a>. When Odin is brought back from Limbo to battle the warriors of the \"Tenth World\" Loki runs away, knowing that Odin would disapprove of his return and the destruction it would undoubtedly cause. Running into Iron Man, Loki was saved by Thor who defended his own reasons for bringing the trickster back.</p><h3>Journey Into Mystery</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1877722\" data-ratio=\"0.95483288166215\" data-width=\"1107\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1107px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1877722\"><img alt=\"rebelling against Ikol\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 1107w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"rebelling against Ikol\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 1107w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/38142/1877722-ikol_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>rebelling against Ikol</figcaption></figure><p>To avoid the disapproval of the citizens of Asgard, Loki announces his intention to travel to the world of men and learn their ways, which Thor approves of. But before he can set off, a magpie (messenger bird) explodes in his chambers while delivering a key to Loki. This leads Loki into the very bowels of Asgard itself where he receives a message from a spiritual echo of his former self, saying that Loki's death at the hands of the Void was part of a greater scheme of death and rebirth and that Loki the child was necessary to complete the plan. However Loki refuses to follow this path, wanting to be his own person, and transforms the spirit of his former self into a magpie named <a href=\"/ikol/4005-77392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77392\">Ikol</a>.

Thor is imprisoned while Odin assembles the Asgardian army to cleanse away the Serpents influence no matter the cost. Meanwhile Loki, who disagreed with Odin's actions, is occupied by <a href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\">Volstagg</a> who orders him to clean the stables of Thor's goats to keep him out of trouble and danger. But most importantly, Volstagg is to keep Loki from interfering with Odin's plans. Ikol convinces Loki that if Odin is to continue on this foolish path it would surely mean the end for them all and Loki quickly escapes. By using the wool of one of the goats, he descends into the roots of the <a href=\"/yggdrasil-the-world-tree/4020-55875/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55875\">World Tree</a> to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there. Their sage wisdom causes Loki to weep because he does not know if theirs is the right path to follow. He seeks advice from Thor and breaks into his prison cell asking for help. Loki asks his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening and what if it cost him everything. With Thor's answer, Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thor's goats. He revealed he needed help from one more 'personage' before heading for the realm of Hela.</p><p>Once there Loki begins to craft his impossible plan together. Pitting <a href=\"/hela/4005-4342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4342\">Hela</a> and <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> against one another. In other words playing both sides against the middle. His endgame is possession over the powerful <a href=\"/disir/4060-57459/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57459\">Dísir</a>, the dead god of war <a href=\"/tyr/4005-25894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25894\">Tyr</a> and the powerful Destroyer Armor. As extra precaution Hela sends her handmaiden <a href=\"/leah/4005-78369/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78369\">Leah</a> along to the destruction of the Serpents \"Anti-Asgard\". But Loki's team or \"Magic Secret Action Squad\" as he calls them is nothing more than a distraction for Loki's real plan. Using the shadow of Surtur's all powerful Twilight Sword, Loki plans to rewrite Asgardian myth and prophesize the Serpents demise at the hands of Thor. Twilight's Shadow is really the world's most powerful pen.</p><h3>Shattered Heroes</h3><p>Thor defeated <a href=\"/the-serpent/4005-77306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77306\">The Serpent</a> but at the cost of his own life, so now Loki was on his own once again, and what was worse, the <a href=\"/all-mothers/4060-59124/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59124\">All-Mothers,</a> the three goddesses left in charge of Asgard, knew what Loki had done. He had free <a href=\"/surtur/4005-10967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10967\">Surtur</a>, made deals with both Hela and <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a>, stole the <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\">Destroyer</a> and had created a litter of demon puppies. The All Mothers, black mailed Loki into being there spy and errand boy. And one day after sending Loki to his room as punishment for starting a fight with a human bully, Loki had a nightmare that <a href=\"/ikol/4005-77392/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77392\">Ikol</a> was forced to wake him from.</p><p>This nightmare lead to the team-up of Loki, Leah and <a href=\"/hellstorm/4005-14695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14695\">Hellstorm</a> to stop <a href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare</a> from killing countless children in comas from the Serpent's fear wave. Loki learned that he had a large deposit of fear stuff in his own head and had Leah take it out. He then traded it to Nightmare for the sake of the other children. This didn't sit well with Helstorm who know the destruction that Nightmare could cause with all the Fear Stuff Loki had given him freely. Loki then explained that he also told the <a href=\"/fear-lords/4060-28159/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-28159\">Fear Lords</a> about Nightmare have so much power and they striped him of it quickly and then began fighting among them selves over who should wield it. Loki pointed out they would never agree to agree and the fear stuff was safe.</p><h3>Everything Burns</h3><p><a href=\"/surtur/4005-10967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10967\">Surtur</a>, having been released during Loki's plans against the Serpent, sets up a plan in order to cause the total destruction of the nine realms. Loki is able to bring about his defeat using his own trickery, and some help from Hela and Leah, to save Asgard. However, after the battle is won, Hellstorm delivers a terrible message: that Mephisto has taken the fear stuff crown, and will use it to gain total control over hell. Loki speaks to his past self, who reveals that since the crown is based on Loki's thoughts, it can only be destroyed with Loki's death. In order to save Asgard and the world, Loki consumes Ikol, effectively killing himself and letting the old Loki take control.</p><h3>Young Avenger</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703069\" data-ratio=\"1.5447154471545\" data-width=\"615\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 615px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703069\"><img alt=\"A new team of heroes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg 615w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A new team of heroes\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg 615w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3347/2703069-yngavn2013002_hansvar_02.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A new team of heroes</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"/wiccan/4005-40505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40505\">Wiccan</a> and <a href=\"/hulkling/4005-2259/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2259\">Hulkling</a> are captured by an interdimensional parasite known as <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mother/4005-91205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91205\">Mother</a>, Loki comes to their aid and rescues them from the prison that they were being held in. They admit that they need help to defeat the creature, but are wary of trusting Loki, knowing who he is. They go to Asgard, and are met with Loki's father. With the help of <a href=\"/ms-america/4005-78932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78932\">Ms. America</a>, the team flee to New York City, but are once again met by the parasite, and are captured.</p><p>They are saved by <a href=\"/kate-bishop/4005-2262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2262\">Kate Bishop</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/noh-varr/4005-11565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11565\">Noh-Var</a>, but are then attacked by citizens of New York, who fall under the control of Mother as the team flies by in Noh-Var's ship. The team flees to Central Park in order to minimize the number of civilians in the area. Once there, Loki tells the group that their only choice to save themselves is to either kill Wiccan, or allow Loki to borrow Wiccan's powers for ten minutes so that he can save them. Seeing no other option, Wiccan agrees, and Loki immediately teleports away, seemingly abandoning the group to face the mob of mind controlled New Yorkers on their own.</p><p>While he intended to leave them to die, Loki has an internal conversation with the child self that he killed at the end of Journey into Mystery, and is convinced to return to the team. Once there, he defeats the creature, but the team is forced to leave New York, as Wiccan's spell is still intact. While the rest of the team is busy, Loki meets with Mother, revealing that he had planned everything that had happened with the parasite, working in order to gain access to Wiccan's immense power so that he can gain back the abilities he lost when he was reincarnated.</p><p>The team is left in a situation where neither Wiccan nor Loki are powerful enough to fight Mother. In order to increase Loki's power, Wiccan ages Loki's body to that of a teenager, increasing his powers. Now able to take on Mother, as well as Leah, who had recruited the exes of the other Young Avengers members, the group goes to Mother's dimension to stop things once and for all.</p><p>In his confrontation with Leah, she taunts him for destroying his younger self. Realizing that she is merely an illusion created by his own guilty conscience, Loki confesses his part in freeing Mother, as well as for killing his younger self. Now sated, the exes and Leah vanish, allowing the Young Avengers to defeat Mother.</p><p>When Wiccan turns to introduce his new teammate to his parents, he finds that Loki is missing, having fled the scene due to his guilt.</p><h3>Agent of Asgard</h3><p>As a part of All New Marvel NOW!, Loki was granted his own solo series. Living in his own apartment (that he has to magically move to different apartment buildings every now and then because people keep mistaking him for Harry Styles), Loki begins to take on missions for the All-Mother. In exchange for his help, certain crimes that he committed in the past are erased and forgotten. He breaks into the prison on Asgardia with the help of Lorelei to discover that his mother had betrayed him by keeping the future Loki alive and well, even going to him for consultations. Loki then refuses to do the bidding of the All-Mother and leaves.</p><h3>The Tenth Realm</h3><p>Thor goes to Loki for help after being exposed to the \"bomb\" set off by the Watcher's eye. He receives glimpses of the past in which he is made to realize that he has a sister and that there is a tenth realm that had been sealed away. With Loki's help, Thor enters the tenth realm - <a href=\"/heven/4020-59636/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59636\">Heven</a>, Land of the Angels. The fierce Angels do battle with Thor. Asgardians are enemies of the Angels.Loki, however, is a Jotuun, not an Asgardian, and therefore works out a deal with the Queen of the Angels. Taking a new female form, Loki becomes the Mistress of Strategies of Heven. Thor faces <a href=\"/angela/4005-11761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11761\">Angela</a> in battle, and he is captured, while Loki leads a battalion of Angelic forces against <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgardia</a>. Understanding that there are shields surrounding the home of the Asgardians, he encourages the Angels to attack head on, leading them to their deaths. With a fleet of Angels down, Loki seeks the help of Odin. Odin and Loki return to Heven prepared to rescue Thor and do battle, when Odin reveals that Angela is in fact his daughter. The Queen of the Angels allows Angela to leave, out of respect for her abilities, but she also renounces her. Angela has nowhere to go, and so before leaving, Loki reminds her that she is his sister, and therefore, she is welcome in his home.</p><h3>March to AXIS</h3><p>Loki returns to his apartment after the events that transpired in the Tenth Realm, to be greeted by his new friend <a href=\"/verity-willis/4005-99142/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-99142\">Verity Willis</a>. She is angry at him for manipulating her, but they don't get much time to work it out, as Doom transports Loki to Castle Doom in Latveria. Doom, after visiting the future, believes that in order to secure the safe future of Earth, Loki needs to be contained. He suggests a magical duel, and ultimately, traps Loki. Verity is with him, however, and is undetected by Doom.</p><h3>Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS</h3><p>After the initial round of fighting between the heroes (Avengers &amp; X-Men) and the Red Onslaught, in which all of the heroes had fallen except for Iron Man, Magneto decided to flee Genosha. He began rounding up a new group of supers - the villains. He reached out to <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth</a>, <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a>, <a href=\"/carnage/4005-1490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1490\">Carnage</a>, the <a href=\"/hobgoblin-kingsley/4005-7605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Hobgoblin</a>, <a href=\"/jack-olantern/4005-40901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40901\">Jack O'Lantern</a>, the <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a>, <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a> - and Loki. The group traveled to Genosha, and battled the Red Onslaught and the super sentinels he had used to take down the heroes. The villains easily defeated the sentinels - something the heroes had not been able to do, and kept the Red Onslaught occupied while Doom and Wanda Maximoff worked their mixture of Order and Chaos magics to create an inversion, which reverted the Red Onslaught back into the Red Skull. The villains disappeared just as the Inversion took place.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4238531\" data-ratio=\"1.5170670037927\" data-width=\"791\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 791px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4238531\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 791w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 791w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4238531-2890546002-Loki_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Loki later reemerges as Loki Agent of AXIS! God of Heroism and Truth. Armed with the sword of truth, Gram, Loki feels the change caused by the Inversion Spell and decides to embrace it, along with a fellow Asgardian and former-villainess, Amora the Enchantress. As a hero, Loki does away with his trademark gold horns, and replaces the dark green ensemble he usually wears with pieces of gold armor, a white and green pattern, and a new headpiece. His first act of heroism occurs when he stops a heist from occurring at the hands of the Ringleader and his circus act-themed villains. For the first time in his life, Loki experiences praise for his actions and receives applause and cheers from the people he rescued. Transforming into a unicorn, Loki gallops away to find his inverted brother. Thor, who, now hammerless, has become the God of Evil, armed with the magical Axe <a href=\"/jarnbjorn/4055-57280/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57280\">Jarnbjorn</a>. Loki finds Thor while Thor is gambling. Loki explains to Thor that the scared civilians are simply letting him win so as not enrage the Asgardian. Thor, angry, attacks Loki, who refuses to fight back, and asks why Loki is trying to help him. Now unable to tell a lie, Loki reveals that it is because he loves his brother. Thor responds by saying that he feels only disgust for Loki. Disheartened, Loki is pulled away from the conflict by Spider-Man passing overhead in an aircraft. Spider-Man reveals that he and Steve Rogers have gathered all the former-villains who have now been inverted to form a new group of Avengers. These former villains will now have to stop both the evil Inverted Avengers and the bellicose warmongering X-Men of Apocalypse.</p><p>Back at his apartment, Loki calls together his \"friends\" - <a href=\"/verity-willis/4005-99142/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-99142\">Verity Willis</a>, <a href=\"/lorelei/4005-45145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45145\">Lorelei</a>, and <a href=\"/sigurd/4005-2765/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2765\">Sigurd.</a> When they arrive at his apartment they find him on his couch being \"friendly\" with his new lover, the inverted <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a>. Disgusted with the new Loki, Lorelei, Sigurd, and Verity leave. Verity takes it the worst, trying to convince herself that her \"bitchy, funny\" friend Loki was never really her friend at all and that she doesn't care, but she does. She calls Lorelei to ask if she can find any magical solution to return Loki to normalcy, but Lorelei says she cannot and that she doesn't care anyway. While conversing on the phone with Verity, Lorelei reveals she is in the middle of committing a crime.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4312533\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"1040\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1040px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4312533\"><img alt=\"Loki is worthy!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 1040w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki is worthy!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 1040w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11119/111191377/4312533-8986078655-14o2f.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki is worthy!</figcaption></figure><p>Loki, among the ranks of the new Avengers, discusses what it really means to \"love\" someone with the Enchantress, who says she wishes to help correct the evil ways of her sister, Lorelei, because she loves her. Amora believes an act of true love is being able to hand her sister over for punishment and imprisonment in Asgardia to pay for her wrongs. Loki is uneasy about this course of action, but even so, he teleports them both to where Lorelei and Sigurd are located. Loki and Amora then overpower and detain the criminal lovers. When Loki returns, Sabretooth informs him that they are about to leave as a group to battle the AXIS of Evil (the inverted Avengers), Apocalypse and the X-Men (who are planning to unleash a gene bomb that would kill those who do not possess the mutant x-gene). During this final battle, Loki taunts an enraged and bloodthirsty Thor into following him through a portal which leads to the moon. Thor, out for blood, attacks Loki with the enchanted axe Jarnbjorn. Loki realizes that his only chance at survival is to grab Thor's hammer Mjolnir (left on the Blue Area of the moon when Thor became unworthy during the events of Original Sin), and hope he has become worthy. As it turns out, Loki IS worthy of lifting Mjolnir and battles Thor with his own hammer. It is Jarnbjorn versus Mjolnir, both weapons of Thor. Thor, still the God of Thunder, calls down a huge blast of lightning to devastate his adoptive brother, but Loki, now wielding Mjolnir, is unaffected by the blast, and nearly defeats Thor with his hammer. During Thor and Loki's battle on the moon, the Scarlet Witch (inverted, but subdued and forced into submission by the spirit of Daniel Drumm who was sent to possess her by <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a>), along with Doctor Doom and the inverted Red Skull (the White Skull with the powers of Charles Xavier) undid the damage that the Inversion Spell had caused. Loki was returned to his old, lying self, and the hammer Mjolnir fell from his grasp as he was no longer worthy to wield it. When Thor returned to his old self, he could not remember what he had done or why he was on the moon. Loki tried to convince him of the truth - that he was worthy of Mjolnir. Thor did not believe him, and Loki returned to Earth. The villains, although they had been the ones acting heroically, took the blame for the antics of the inverted Avengers and X-Men, so that the common people's faith in their heroes would be restored.</p><p> </p><h3>God of Stories</h3><p>With the inversion undone and the Heroes now restored to their former selves, Loki soon discovers that, added to the fact that he is now again unworthy of wielding Mjolnir, he has also lost the ability to Lie. Thor (Odinson), still being unworthy of his own powers and seeing that his brother is now in a similar situation regarding his powers, decides to join his brother and talk. While talking with his brother, Thor notes how Loki no longer acts the same as he did when he was Kid Loki. In response to this, Loki, now unable to keep the truth hidden through his inability to lie, reveals to Thor the truth about himself. He reveals that he is not the same Loki, but rather the echo of the Old Loki who killed and possessed the body of the younger Loki. In Thor's eyes, Loki has committed a crime which cannot be forgiven. Thor, enraged by this revelation, beats Loki with his fists, bruising him badly. Thor then takes him to Asgardia where he repeats Loki's confession to his fellow gods. Like Thor, they do not take the revelation well and turn their backs on him, treating him as though he doesn't exist. The final blow is then delivered by Freya who exiles Loki from Asgardia.</p><p> </p><p>Upon his exile Loki returns to Earth and meets up with Verity Willis. They talk about plans about what to do with his new found exile. These plans are stopped before they can even begin as the future King Loki suddenly appears and takes the younger Loki prisoner and, in the process, scares Verity off by telling her terrible truths about the future. Now a prisoner of his future self, Loki listens as King Loki explains the events leading up to him arriving back into the past. It begins by him escaping from a battle against King Thor, at a point in which Thor and the other Asgardians were at their most vulnerable, so that he could help his (now imprisoned) younger self change their own destiny. King Loki then goes on to explain how he (from his time) went from being the noble and heroic Agent of Asgard to his current evil self - detailing how over 10 years young Loki would complete enough missions for Asgard to abolish him of any crime/foul deed committed by Old Loki, yet despite his actions his fellow Asgardians still did not trust him. For although he may no longer have been the God of Evil, Loki was still the God of Lies. This disdain would lead to resentment, which would lead Loki, the Agent of Asgard, to become the Evil King Loki. Having explained this to his younger self, King Loki sets his younger self metaphorically (and literally to his own surprise) aflame, hoping to quicken his transition and his rise to power.</p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5013689\" data-ratio=\"1.5414141414141\" data-width=\"495\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 495px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5013689\"><img alt=\"Loki: God of Stories\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg 495w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki: God of Stories\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg 495w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/58109/5013689-tumblr_inline_nn8xm4emlw1qec1pk_540.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki: God of Stories</figcaption></figure><p>With Loki now having been burnt, his mind/soul/being/essence falls within itself where he encounters Odin who greets him as his child, the child is both a son and a daughter (referencing Original Sin). Odin explains how he's known who THIS Loki has been since his return, but then goes on to tell Loki that rather than his past or (possible) future incarnations who have tried to claim Thor's power as their own, the present Loki should instead try to reclaim and better understand his own powers. Odin queries to Loki \"what is a Lie?\" before vanishing. Loki then encounters the two ghosts (or echoes) of his former selves standing between a pillar upon which sits the helmet/crown of Loki. Both ghosts/echoes tell Loki that he has one of two choices, to pick up the crown and become the pale imitation of his evil older self which the Asgardians, and King Loki, want him to be (for what would a story of brave heroes and warriors be without a villain), or to destroy himself and complete his story with no regrets like his younger self did. As the two ghosts/echoes try and convince him, Loki is (surprisingly) able to talk to Verity who apologises to him for her reaction to King Loki's truths but who also asks Loki, now standing between the 2 echoes, what does \"god of lies\" even mean? It's then that Loki truly starts to think about his power and answers the question saying \"a lie is a story told\". It's at this point that Loki picks up the crown and decides to take a third option, his own path, noting how stories can be changed and thus this time around he will tell a different story. As the crown is placed upon his head Loki's physical body (still burning in the presence of King Loki on Earth) explodes, resulting in both young and old/King Loki being sent 8 months into the future (to the beginning of the events of Secret Wars), upon which young Loki escapes and returns to the home of Verity, declaring to her that \"<em>I'm the God of Stories. Im Loki</em>\".</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 4'4, (as adult) 6'0\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 168 lbs, (as adult) 525 lbs</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Green</li><li><b>Hair Color</b>: Black, (as adult) Black-Grey</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Jotumheim, Asgard</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> Asgard</li><li><b>Education</b>: Extensive training in the Black Arts</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer, former God of Evil &amp; Mischief</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/sigyn/4005-13478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13478\">Sigyn</a> (wife, deceased), <a href=\"/fenris-wolf/4005-41946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41946\">Fenris Wolf</a>, <a href=\"/midgard-serpent/4005-14471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14471\">Midgard Serpent,</a> <a href=\"/sleipnir/4005-59602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59602\">Sleipnir</a>, <a href=\"/agamemnon/4005-25967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25967\">Vali Halfling</a>, (sons), <a href=\"/hela/4005-4342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4342\">Hela</a>, <a href=\"/morwen/4005-59864/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59864\">Tess Black</a>, (Daughters), <a href=\"/laufey/4005-31821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31821\">Laufey</a> (father, deceased), Farbauti (Mother, deceased), <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin Borson</a> (adoptive father), <a href=\"/frigga/4005-7197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7197\">Frigga</a> (adoptive mother), <a href=\"/balder/4005-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\">Balder</a>, <a href=\"/hermod/4005-12719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12719\">Hermod</a>, <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor Odinson</a>, <a href=\"/tyr/4005-25894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25894\">Tyr</a> (adoptive brothers), <a href=\"/angela/4005-11761/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11761\">Aldrif Odinsdottir</a> (adoptive sister), <a href=\"/vidar/4005-32047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32047\">Vidar</a> (adoptive brother, deceased), <a href=\"/arkin-the-weak/4005-39063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-39063\">Arkin</a> (cousin, deceased)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315513\" data-ratio=\"1.4244444444444\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1315513\"><img alt=\"God of Mischief\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 673w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"God of Mischief\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 673w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1315513-123_thor__first_thunder_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>God of Mischief</figcaption></figure><p>Loki is the son of Frost Giants and as so is endowed with superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability. Loki is able to press 50 tons without magically enhancing his natural strength. Despite not usually attempting to physically challenge opponents, he is capable of overpowering strong foes, and striking with enough force to destroy a large building with one strike. He is able to dodge bullets, fight continually for up to twenty four hours before beginning to feel tired, and has a healing factor superior to any normal human. Loki possesses superhuman-durability, and is able to withstand powerful energy blasts, falls form great heights, temperature and pressure extremes, and powerful impact forces, as well as imumnity to human diseases and toxins.</p><p>He is extremely long-lived and immune to all Earthly diseases and has, after recent events, obtained immortality. This does not mean that he is immune to harm, but is denied access to Hel's dimension. He is often credited as a genius, as witnessed in the Acts of Vengeance storyline, and considered to be second only to Odin in Asgard when comparing intellect. Further more, Loki is especially skilled at persuasion and can often use this to confuse, dissuade or weaken his opponents, as well as join others to his cause. A testament to this is the fact that Loki has been allowed back into Asgard after attempting to kill Thor, and being caught doing so, nearly a hundred times. The greatest of Loki's plans is often foiled because of his obsessive need to humiliate Thor. He has admitted that instead of ruling worlds and conquering alien nations, he is bound to earth solely to torment Thor.</p><p>Loki is the most skilled magician in all of Asgard, if not in all the nine worlds. His magic is thought to be derived from two sources: his innate ability to manipulate Asgardian energy, and his vast knowledge of sorcery. The abilities Loki has shown are energy manipulation and projection, flight, teleportation, matter manipulation, the enhancing of his physical attributes, and so on. Loki can levitate objects with his mind, and this power seems devastating and chaotic in nature. He can even grant people and objects superhuman abilities, as an example, he was the one who gave the Absorbing Man his powers. He has also boosted a low telepath's power to the point where he could easily defeat Thor. Loki had projected illusions which have fooled entire cities, and even Surtur. He has telepathically contacted a Skrull deep in space while he himself was imprisoned. He has changed clouds into dragons, and a car into ice cream. Loki can also add his powers to another's, and has done so with Thor and the Silver Surfer. There is virtually no limit to the things he can accomplish through magic. His magic, however, is believed to be slightly weaker on Earth, as the Asgardians all become weaker on Earth.</p><h3>Paraphernalia</h3><p>In addition to his innate powers, Loki has several magical items at his disposal. This includes but is not limited to a scrying pool, the norn stones, magical whip, a special fire sword and a dagger which is equal to Mjolnir. At times he will call upon these items to assist him in battle, though only the norn stones and fire-sword seem to have made an appearance since the 80s.</p><p>He currently makes extensive use of the Sword of Truth known as Gram.

Hailing form Asgard, Loki was born to the Norse god-king Odin and the Queen of the Frost Giants as part of a peace treaty between Asgard and Jottunheim. As such, even though Loki fought alongside his brothers Balder and Thor as part of the 'Warriors Three' he was also half brother to the Frost Giant Prince Mammon and thus was torn between his loyalty to his father versus his loyalty to his mother. Growing up in Asgard, Loki became known as the God of Mischief for his pranks and trickster nature, Balder though, rather viewed his brother as a Grim figure tied to his conviction that Ragnarok would occur. As one of the sons of Odin, Loki fought for Asgard during the war against Jottunheim, though following Asgard's victory he himself made clear that his initial aims of mischief and bringing about Ragnarok were now his primary objectives. As such, he eventually stole the Norn Stones to please his mother, murdering Balder in the process (an act for which Loki was banished). However, the self appointed God of Mischief and Chaos patiently waited for an opportunity to destroy Asgard. He eventually succeeded when he posed as <a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Zemo</a> in order to procure 100,000 SS men from the German Third Reich. With his 100,000 SS soldiers combined with an army of Frost Giants under his half-brother Mammon, Loki stormed the walls of Asgard and burned the World Tree before facing his brother Thor and father Odin. However, the trickster was outmatched and Odin, infuriated by Balder's death, imprisoned his wayward son within the 'Room with no doors'. Nevertheless, even though Asgard was destroyed, Loki remained imprisoned, brooding upon the favoritism his father Odin showed to Thor and the best means by which to disrupt his father's plans for Midgard (Earth).</p><p>Following the failed alien invasion, Loki escaped his prison and made his way to Earth to take revenge against Thor. He conspired with the <a href=\"/liberators/4060-51531/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51531\">Liberators</a> to destroy the Ultimates, and start World War III per his role as God of Mischief. Reborn as a God, (whereas Thor and Balder had been reborn as mortals), Loki used his powers over reality in order to create the identity of Gunnar Golmen, the scientist brother of a delusional Thorlief Golmen (allegedly posing as Thor). The Norwegian super-soldier program and Thor's past life as Thorlief were all fabricated to make Thor appear insane and turn the Ultimates against him. Loki also used his powers to frame Captain America for the murder of Hawkeye's family. His plans culminated in the invasion of the United States, where he participated as one of the leaders. Throughout all these events, he hesitated from using his powers openly, since doing so would enable his father to find him.</p><p>Despite the careful planning of the Liberators, the Ultimates were able to turn the tables, and kill most of the Liberators and their soldiers. Faced with little alternative, Loki decided to take matters into his own hands and destroy the Ultimates himself, but before he could do so, the Scarlet Witch used her probability-powers to summon Loki's brother Thor.</p><p>Faced with his angry brother, Loki attempted to trap him in an illusion, but for unknown reasons, according to Thor, Loki's powers had begun to weaken. After surviving uninjured from a direct assault from Thor, Loki decided to simply kill Thor and all the Ultimates by summoning an army of Asgardian monsters, while battling Thor himself. At this point, Loki had lost all fear of Odin and was on the verge of killing Thor before Odin intervened. Odin sent an army of warriors of Asgard to battle the monsters and removed most of Loki's powers, making him vulnerable to Thor's hammer and presumably restoring Thor's Asgardian power. Without his powers and outmatched by Thor, Loki pleaded with his brother and ranted about how he had been merely jealous of Thor and wanted to see him fail. He also pointed out the absurdness of his manipulations and the humor in humans failing to realize it. Thor, not impressed, summoned a huge lighting bolt and banished him back to Asgard for punishment from Odin.</p><p>After the <a href=\"/ultimatum/4045-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55745\">Ultimatum Wave</a>, the Ultimates were no longer viable, but with the help of <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> and <a href=\"/carol-danvers/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers </a>they reformed the group into two separate teams: the Avengers and New Ultimates. Ka-Zar and Shanna also joined the Ultimates, but suddenly an army of Asgardian beast's arrived with a girl named Amora and Loki himself, who now wore a more Earth '616' looking suit.</p><p><b>MC2 (Earth-982)</b></p><p>Still regretting his actions for the formation of the Avengers, Loki brainwashed them to wreak havoc on Earth, thus destroying their reputation as heroes. It wasn't until the young superheroes and especially Captain America, who broke the gem that Loki was using to brainwash the older heroes right as they were about to kill innocent people, was Loki stopped and defeated. For his actions, Loki was banished to limbo, with the Hulk following him, to punish him for what he had done to the heroes.</p><p><b>Earth X (Earth-9997)</b></p><p>It has been revealed through the monitoring devices of the Watcher, as well as through the eyes of Kyle Richmond, that the Asgardians of Earth-9997 are not gods, as have long been believed.</p><p>As it has been revealed, the Asgardians are really aliens who, like humanity, had been manipulated by the Celestials to be guardians of the Celestial embryo growing at the core of their planet. Like many of the species the Celestials have manipulated, this species lived long enough to evolve to the third tier of mutation. This level causes the individual to lose all definition and is defined by those around it, or its environment.</p><p>At some point the aliens whom later became the Asgardians, left their planet in a ship that was also without definition (which could have been some of their own fellow beings that were \"willed\" into becoming a craft for the others to travel thru space in) and eventually arrived on Earth hundreds of years ago.</p><p>They landed near a small Norse village where the town story teller, named Donnerson, who had a bad eye and lame leg and loved the myths of Asgard, was the only villager brave enough to confront these beings. He was manipulated by Mephisto (disguised as a human) to will these beings into the Asgardian people. Calling himself \"Odin\", he merged with his two \"brothers\" to fight \"Surtur\" and so Donnerson became Odin.</p><p>As Odin, Donnerson manipulated all the aliens into becoming the Asgardian race, and even the Asgardian realm itself. Hence, Loki was created, and existed solely on the will of Donnerson himself. However, the continued belief of Asgard amongst the people of Earth also played an important part in maintaining Asgard's definition.</p><p>In the 20th century when most of the world began to believe in Asgard as only a myth, Asgard was at risk of losing its definition. Odin originally sent his son Thor to Earth in the guise of Donald Blake to rekindle the belief in Asgard by having Thor return during a time when super human beings began appearing on Earth.</p><p>To further cement humanity's belief in Asgard, Odin allowed other beings from Asgard (specifically Loki himself) to interact with the people of Earth. It has also been said that Odin manipulated the events that caused Loki to be responsible for the original members of the Avengers to band together as yet another plan to reaffirm the existence of Asgard in the minds of mortal men.</p><p>At some point during this time, Loki had convinced Odin to teach Thor another lesson in humility and convinced the All-Father to turn Thor into a woman. Loki later cast a spell that would trap Thor in Asgard should she ever return there to tell Odin that Loki had tricked him into punishing Thor, giving Loki free reign on Earth.</p><p>Later, Loki was involved in a scheme to assassinate Dr. Stephen Strange, by Mephisto, who was manipulating Strange's long time man servant, Wong. Wong had cast a simple infatuation spell on Clea (whom he plotted to use as a tool to kill Strange), Clea fell in love with Loki due to this enchantment, and also slew Strange's mortal body with a spell which trapped his astral form in the Land of the Dead.</p><p>Loki later revealed to Captain America and Mar-Vel, that he was involved with the whole affair in order to prevent Clea and Wong from releasing the Mindless Ones into Earth's dimension. That he had involved himself so that he could also seal Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorium to prevent any evil that the two betrayers might unleash upon the mortal world.</p><p>Not long after orchestrating the betrayal of Dr. Strange, Loki attacked New York with a number of Frost Giants. These giants were defeated by Thor and the Iron Avengers. Loki escaped after the battle.</p><p>After being forced to battle their friends and loved ones (including Sif and Balder) and being subject to Odin creating a new fantasy world out of Asgard, Thor and Loki were able to defeat Odin by having X-51 reveal the truth about Odin's past, and that Asgard was all a manipulation orchestrated by Donnerson and Mephisto. Thor then chopped down Yggdrasil, giving X-51 a map to travel in and out of the different realities in the multiverse without creating another divergent reality. The Asgardians, upon learning the truth about Odin and their own nature, returned to their original alien forms and left Donnerson to die in the void of space. However, they later returned and restored Asgard and Donnerson as Odin after his impassioned pleas for forgiveness.</p><p>Returning to Earth, Thor and Loki decided to choose their own destinies. Loki chose to become a hero and take on the identity of Thor and form his own team of Avengers, while the real Thor returned to his guise of Donald Blake, feeling that he could do more good as a simple mortal doctor than he could have ever done as Thor.</p><p>Later, after the death of Mephisto, and the victory on Earth, Loki gathered Ransak the Reject and Black Bolt together. There, Loki transformed himself into Thor and the trio then became a new incarnation of the Avengers.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h4><b><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</a> (1981-1983)</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6646650\" data-ratio=\"0.744\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6646650\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646650-2585460323-17298.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</figcaption></figure><p>Loki appears in the episode \"The Vengeance of Loki,\" voiced by John Stephenson.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/the-super-hero-squad-show/4075-158/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-158\">The Super Hero Squad Show </a>(2009)</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6646651\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6646651\"><img alt=\"Super Hero Squad\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Super Hero Squad\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6646651-3184236040-10480.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Super Hero Squad</figcaption></figure><p>Loki appears in several episodes voiced by Ted Biaselli.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/4075-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-18\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes </a>(2010-2012)</b></h4><p>Loki appears in the episode \"Thor the Mighty,\" voiced by Graham McTavish. He is shown trying to conquer Asgard by manipulating a group of Frost Giants into attacking the realm while Odin is on the verge of the Odinsleep and Thor is on Earth.

In \"This Hostage Earth\", Loki attempts to invade Earth by having the Masters of Evil steal the <a href=\"../../norn-stones/18-56330/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norn Stones</a> from the sorceress <a href=\"../../karnilla/29-7198/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karnilla</a> in order to transport his forces to Midgard and effortlessly conquer the planet. However, his plan fails, as the Avengers manage to destroy the stones and in the process transport themselves to each of the eight mythical realms. In \"The Fall of Asgard,\" Thor is captured by Loki who reveals to him that he is behind everything that has happened relating to Thor's exile and the creation of the Avengers, including the super-villain prison breakout and the creation of the Masters of Evil, with Loki admitting that his initial attack on Asgard and exile in \"Thor the Mighty\" was simply a diversion so that Thor would not perceive Loki as a threat while on Earth. Lastly, in \"A Day Unlike Any Other\", Loki is shown engaging the Avengers and numerous Asgardian warriors in their last battle to stop the God of Mischief from conquering the nine realms. As such, Loki notably showcases his new found control of the Odinforce by destroying Captain America's shield and fighting Iron Man in his Thor-buster Armor to a standstill. However, Loki loses control of the Odinforce and almost brings about Ragnarok, but is stopped when Ant-Man disconnects him from the Tree of Life, allowing Odin to regain consciousness and banish Loki to a place far worse than the Isle of Silence. Despite his defeat, Loki pledges to Odin and the Avengers that he will never stop trying to conquer Asgard and that Odin will suffer a thousand times worse for anything that he inflicts on Loki in the meantime.

This is the most positive portrayal of Loki, showing him as a young boy of around fourteen or fifteen who is just beginning to learn magic and who has great love and trust for both Thor and Odin. Here Loki is portrayed as mischievous but also goodhearted and naive with a loving relationship with both Thor and Odin, willing to sneak off with his brother to find adventure. During their journey through Jotunheim Loki is not affected by the cold while Thor and the warriors three are shivering hinting at his frost giant heritage. He is also seen as more cautious and reasonable than the impulsive Thor in being afraid of the power of the Sword of Surtur and urging Thor to get rid of it. At the climax of the film he kills Algrim (Kurse: here portrayed as a trusted adviser of Odin who also blames him for the destruction of his people) with the Sword of Surtur and a hint of his darker nature is shown.</p><h4><strong><a href=\"/avengers-age-of-ultron/4025-1563/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1563\">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> (2015)</strong></h4><p>Tom Hiddleston filmed a cameo as Loki, but it was cut from the finished movie.</p><h4><strong><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thor-ragnarok/4025-2278/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-2278\">Thor: Ragnarok</a> (2017)</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6313135\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6313135\"><img alt=\"Loki in Ragnarok\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 1600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Loki in Ragnarok\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 1600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6313135-4587699468-thor-r.jpeg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Loki in Ragnarok</figcaption></figure><p>Tom Hiddleston returns in the third <em>Thor</em> film.

It is revealed that Thanos has come seeking the Tesseract, which Loki stole from the Asgardian treasure vault just prior to the world's destruction at Surtur's hands. Loki initially pretends not to have the Tesseract, but gives it up when Thanos begins torturing Thor. Thanos then destroys the Tesseract, revealing the <a href=\"/space-gem/4055-57127/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57127\">Space Stone</a> within. Loki pledges to serve the villains, offering to act as a guide on Earth. However, his offer is merely meant to distract Thanos so that Loki can get close enough to stab him with a dagger. The ploy nearly works, but Thanos is able to stop the blade by using the Space Stone. He then proceeds to violently strangle Loki to death for his treachery while a helpless Thor watches on in anguish.</p><h3><b>Video Games</b></h3><h4><b>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241683\" data-ratio=\"2.1713147410359\" data-width=\"251\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 251px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:217.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-241683\"><img alt=\"Marvel Ultimate Alliance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px\" data-width=\"251\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg 251w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Marvel Ultimate Alliance\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/241683-134042-loki.jpg 251w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px\" data-width=\"251\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>Loki appears to be a NPC boss in the game voiced by Larry Cedar. Loki was often an enemy of Thor, his brother, and allied with Dr. Doom, Ultron, Baron Mordo and Enchantress forming the Masters of Evil. When his allies attacked the the SHIELD Helicarrier and Omega Base they stole the Mutant amplifier and super solider serum which they used to create an army of bestial super soldiers which Loki later released upon Asgard along with an army of Frost Giants. Having conquered Asgard and captured several of the gods including Balder Odinson, Heimdall and Tyr he crowned himself Ruler of Asgard. While Doom put his own plans, to steal the Odinforce from Odin and become a god, into action, Loki fought a team of superheroes and tricked them by disguising himself as Col. Nick Fury and then having them help him to unlock the powerful Destroyer armor. Loki was defeated, however, when the superhero team tricked Loki into injuring him himself with the armor.

After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his <a href=\"../../uncle-ben/29-3114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncle Ben</a> and <a href=\"../../aunt-may/29-1780/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aunt May</a> in a <a href=\"/forest-hills-residence/4020-57247/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57247\">modest house</a> in Forest Hills, <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>. While still in <a href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\">High School</a>, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a <a href=\"/radioactive-spider/4055-56442/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56442\">radioactive spider</a>, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a \" <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a>\" that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities – and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against <a href=\"/crusher-hogan/4005-15480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15480\">Crusher Hogan</a>. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterwards while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn’t his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben’s killer, Peter saw that it was the same <a href=\"/the-burglar/4005-15279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15279\">burglar</a> he didn’t stop at the arena… thus learning that \"<a href=\"/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/4015-40616/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40616\">with great power comes great responsibility</a>\".</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\"><img alt=\"Spidey's First Appearance\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Spidey's First Appearance</figcaption></figure><p>In 1962, <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a> editor and head writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> was looking for a new superhero idea. He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired for the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman</a> to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/4050-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a>, which was renamed <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for an initial character design. However Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby’s attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.</p><p>He has a extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on said side.</p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate period.</p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.</p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 – Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle’s death. Even though <a href=\"/maxie-shiffman/4005-25215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\">Maxie Shiffman</a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn’t want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"/mr-vale/4005-83138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83138\">Mr. Vale</a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"/the-undertaker/4005-83137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83137\">The Undertaker</a>. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight he discovered his <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a> for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben’s death, by using his powers to help others.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.66429298067141\" data-width=\"983\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn’t want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility over money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"/josephine-pulaski/4005-25313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25313\">Joey Pulaski</a> became friends. However it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">The Kingpin</a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey’s defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super powered being Spider-Man had encountered.</p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man’s fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. As the host began to introducing the show’s guests he was attacked by the super powered villain <a href=\"/supercharger/4005-41244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41244\">Supercharger</a>, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super powered beings were. Spider-Man had never encountered a super villain before and thought real super heroes should deal with this. He attempted to call <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain. “because that’s what super heroes do”.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Becoming a Hero</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61647727272727\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 704px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\"><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death</figcaption></figure><p>Peter's first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon</a> who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vulture</a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw, since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape shifting <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a>, the lethal <a href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">Lizard</a>, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"/enforcers/4060-32265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a>, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, and his soon to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"../../sinister-six/65-40429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Six</a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> and <a href=\"/betty-brant/4005-2484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\">Betty Brant</a>. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"/molten-man/4005-11554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11554\">Molten Man</a>, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of <a href=\"/liz-allan/4005-15408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\">Liz Allen</a>. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">the X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, and the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with <a href=\"/ned-leeds/4005-12354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12354\">Ned Leeds</a>.</p><h3><b>College Years</b></h3><p>After graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a>) where Flash introduced him to <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"../../anna-may-watson/29-33193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anna Watson's</a> niece <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane</a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, <a href=\"../../captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Captain George Stacy</a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in <a href=\"../../london/34-55798/\" rel=\"nofollow\">London</a>.</p><h3>Arch-Nemesis: Green Goblin</h3><p>After suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter's Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority. The Web-Slinger managed to defeat him and knocked him into some chemicals, resulting in Norman having amnesia and no recollection of both his and Peter's alternate egos.</p><p>Spider-Man also fought the <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shocker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scorpion</a>. At one point, Peter felt that he was unable to carry the burden of being Spider-Man any longer and considered retiring from super-heroics. When the <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a> of Crime made his move to take over the city, Peter knew that it was still his responsibility to protect the innocent and so he defeated this crime-lord and returned to crime fighting.</p><h3><b>Death of Gwen Stacy and Aftermath</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0538194444444\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\"><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of Spider-Man's defining moments</figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a>, Norman Osborn's memories began to flood back. He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. He tracked him down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"../../jackal/29-10974/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miles Warren</a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>. He hired the <a href=\"../../punisher/29-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Punisher</a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter copy</a> escaped and <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy-clone/29-52936/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwen's copy</a> eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father's death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry's psychologist, <a href=\"../../bart-hamilton/29-34978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Hamilton</a> attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.</p><h3><b>Secret Wars and the Symbiote</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5324324324324\" data-width=\"370\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 370px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyonder</a> transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battleworld</a> to take place in the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars</a>, an intergalactic battle between the world’s greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man’s suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">black substance</a> which slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Arachne's</a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards</a> who told him that it's actually a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">living alien symbiote</a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit's design, Spider-Man's then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a> made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eddie Brock</a> to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a>.</p><h3><b>Death of Jean DeWolff</b></h3><p>A close friend of Peter's, <a href=\"/jean-dewolff/4005-2471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\">Jean DeWolff</a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"/sin-eater/4005-11206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater</a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side.

For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben Reilly</a> spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a threat, but later on the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, until his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.</p><h3>The Identity Crisis</h3><p>After this saga, the <a href=\"/spider-man-identity-crisis/4045-55684/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55684\">Identity Crisis</a> story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, who had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man's head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually Peter's name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.</p><h3>Gathering of the Five</h3><p>It seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a life-time. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago, and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why 'aunt May' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary-Jane.</p><h3>A New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ratio=\"1.1566820276498\" data-width=\"651\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 651px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\"><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman</figcaption></figure><p>After Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary-Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter's good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder then it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, who got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman, when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to the life as a superhero.</p><p>All seemed to go well again until Mary-Jane, who had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary-Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary-Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary-Jane's death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter's memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man's fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary-Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary-Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time of from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.</p><h3><b>A Death in the Family</b></h3><p>Norman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called <a href=\"../../a-death-in-the-family/39-56294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Death in the Family</a>. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen's death to the media, claiming that Gwen's death was the result of Spider-Man's selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn's warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin's game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.</p><h3>Ezekiel</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man and Ezekiel</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, who knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy who will try to kill him, known as Morlun.

Jackal is revealed to be working on a scheme, recruiting several spider-powered criminals for some kind of project. Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at an lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider-powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be 'tested'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider-powers, but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man, when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider's face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well.The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.</p><p>Reed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based off of Anti-Venom's symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.</p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship to Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several octobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.</p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire Stats Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.</p><h3>Ends of the Earth</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\"><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mind Controlled Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Doc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn't believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock's true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can't stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock's facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they're attacked by a group of mind controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio's technology. Black Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto's plot once and for all. They unfortunately meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he's running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc's metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable's life.</p><h3><b>No Turning Back</b></h3><p>It's been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock's plan and now Peter is invited to MJ's, which is Mary Jane's Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sables death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the grounds keeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius' actions, starts to attack him, but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and the confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period for time, but finaly Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor's back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt's body. The Lizard awakens Morbius' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted with Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serums turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn't work. Only at the end we see that the cure has actually worked and now Connors' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard's body.</p><h3><b>Alpha</b></h3><p>A teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn't publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous. He then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man's sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called from Captain America to fight him. During the fight Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.</p><h3>Dying Wish</h3><p>Using a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter's memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus's dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man's life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock's own contingency plans had <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man</a> and <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a> free himself from the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> prison <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a>. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter's memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter's personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.</p><h3><b>Superior Spider-Man</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\"><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?</figcaption></figure><p>However, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus's mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life, tries to influence Octavius, but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker's remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter's genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl's brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker's presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter's memories.</p><p>After Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker’s memories in an attempt to solve a revirbium related problem, Peter's consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter's consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote's hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.</p><p>Peter Parker's re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he's more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain the control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus's memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the amount of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius's birth. Peter Parker's consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto's memories.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Hazel</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Brown</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Forest Hills, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Education:</b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/richard-parker/4005-15261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\">Richard Parker</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"/mary-parker/4005-15262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\">Mary Parker</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Benjamin Parker</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker</a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"/amy-reilly/4005-65796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65796\">Amy Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/amanda-reilly/4005-66173/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66173\">Amanda Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/alexa-reilly/4005-65797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65797\">Alexa Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Benjamin Reilly</a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> (clone), <a href=\"/spidercide/4005-25666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide</a> (clone).</li></ul><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5145454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.</p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.</p><p><b>Spider-Sense</b></p><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"/michele-gonzales/4005-62208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62208\">Michele Gonzales</a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired or when he chooses to ignore it although its difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn't very effective due to the Spidey's previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses, but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Strength</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a heights of much greater three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a> and <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. It's also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus's nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces less fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours, and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man's best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle, after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn't have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility and Reflexes</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outran speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference of Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balance in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point blank range- after the bullet had been fired.</p><p><b>Superhuman Durability</b></p><p>Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super powered individuals. For example he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline he tanked a building destroying explosion, but was significantly weakened afterwards. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man's body \"as being as hard as concrete\".</p><p>However, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can, and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet which pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, Spider-Man healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.</p><p><b>Wall Crawling</b></p><p>Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New-York, but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.</p><h4><b>Organic Webbing</b></h4><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.</p><h4><b>Superhuman Stamina</b></h4><p>Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously, and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.</p><h4><b>Regenerative Healing Factor</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino, but was fine in the next issue.</p><h4><b>Foreign Chemical Resistance</b></h4><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings, but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.</p><h4>Superhuman Sight</h4><p>Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses, and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense. Perhaps most impressively, during Spider-Island, a depowered Hercules with Spider-Man's power-set said he could see bullets in slow motion.</p><h4><b>Skills</b></h4><p>On top of his spider-given powers Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology and physics. This has become particularly apparent during his time working at Horizon Labs, where he was able to create a device to drain Alpha of his powers in less than 24 hours.</p><p>He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat through the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man's reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.</p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider sense. He began training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called the \"Way of the Spider\". It was then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists of among other things, hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed. This new martial art has considerably improved Spider-Man's H2H capabilities, and so far he has stalemated Julia Carpenter and effortlessly defeated 3 spider-powered individuals in a few seconds during Spider-Island. When he regained his Spider-Sense, he defeated a mutated Kaine who was considerably stronger and quicker than him, and effortlessly trumped a mind controlled Spider-Woman, in handful of blows and kicks.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h4><b>Web-Shooters</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2269938650307\" data-width=\"326\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 326px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\"><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's web-shooters broken down</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man's most famous piece of equipment is his self built <a href=\"/web-shooters/4055-42426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\">web-shooters</a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter's own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, as fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man's primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.</p><h4><b>Utility Belt</b></h4><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"../../spider-signal/18-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Signal</a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera and his mask when not in costume.</p><h4><b>Camera</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses his father's automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man's chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/65-40822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Bugle</a>.</p><h4><b>Spider-Tracer</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Tracer</a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100 mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.</p><h4><b>Mask</b></h4><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man's colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.</p><h4><b>Spider-Mobile</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"/spider-mobile/4055-15441/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile</a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle in which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer</a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.</p><h4>Equipment since working at Horizon Labs</h4><p>At Horizons Labs, the combination of a well paying job and access to numerous tech has allowed Peter to expand on the equipment he uses. So far he has developed a Spider-Glider, Thermodynamic Foam, Cryo Pellets, voice activated web-shooters and various types of webbing, including magnetic and acidic variants. Many of the equipment have usage in day-to-day usage as well- for example the cryo pellet technology was used to help keep organs and limbs viable for longer periods of time. The Thermodynamic foam also has use in the stopping and prevention of fires.</p><p><b><i>Spider-bots</i></b></p><p>Dock ock created specific spectators which keep watch of new york, saving spider-mans the trouble to patrol.</p><h2><b>Costumes</b></h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man's costumes in his costume gallery.</p><p>It is Spider-Man's original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man's essential traits. During Spidey's early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrank and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.</p><h3><b>Black Suit</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it, he had an unlimited supply of webbing, and the suit could mimic his civilian clothing. It didn't, contrary to popular belief, enhance his powers. After meeting with Mr Fantastic, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"/kravens-last-hunt/4045-43327/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43327\">Kraven's last Hunt</a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man's heart like never before. He wore the black costume to show this dark side, becoming much more ruthless towards enemies (using torture for example). Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter's \"brother\" Kaine. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-40598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Arana</a>. The black suit represents Spider-Man's dark side.</p><h3><b>Iron Spider suit</b></h3><p><b>See: <a href=\"/iron-spider-costume/4055-55797/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55797\">Iron Spider Costume</a></b></p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\"><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Spider</figcaption></figure><p>After the \" <a href=\"/spider-man-the-other/4045-43776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43776\">Other</a>\" story arc, Tony Stark designed for Peter a specialized Red &amp; Gold costume that is similar to Tony Stark's Iron Man costume. It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he's worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while.

He also created special lenses so that he can be seen by people if needs be. The lighting on the suit can change between green, orange and blue. Orange is for the secondary mode which disrupts sonic frequencies from infrasonic to ultrasonic but is visible. Blue is it in normal mode which can be seen and heard. However, a side effect of this costume is that while he can be impervious to sonic attacks, it also prevents him from hearing others. For example, while fighting the Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, Spider-Man was unable to hear the Cat's cries for help.</p><h3><b>Future Foundation Costume</b></h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.4148471615721\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:241.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\"><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation</figcaption></figure><p>When Peter joined The Future Foundation he was given a new costume by <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Sue Storm</a>.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC September 9, 1967 and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City</p><p>university</p><p>while witnessing a radiology experiment would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider's leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter's first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had ran past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn't really care at the time and didn't help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben's death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle's murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime fighter protecting New York. Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson. This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there's a hang-up, you'll find the Spider-Man!\"</p><h4><b>Spider-Man (1978)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.96333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\"><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Japanese Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel's famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a>.

When his father was killed exploring the ship, Takuya meets the lone survivor from Spider. It gives him a bracelet that not only grants him the same costume and the same powers as the American version but it also allows him to summon a giant robot (which looks an awful lot like a Power Ranger zord) to fight the evil of Professor Monster and his monstrous minions.

This was the second animated production of Spider-Man after its original series that started in 1967. This series was produced by the newly formed Marvel Productions, having risen from the ashes of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The company that had produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series. This version's character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"../../john-romita/26-7499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Romita</a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid 60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a</p><p>college student</p><p>who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as: Peter's Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson's secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"../../robbie-robertson/29-1782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robbie Robertson</a>, Jameson's assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as: Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio and the Chameleon. This also included a six part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends </a>(1981)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981 and lasted through September 10, 1983.This would be the third animated adventure for Spidey which would end up being more popular than its previous series Spider-Man, which ended the same year this new show would start. After Spider-Man in 1981, NBC wanted to take Spider-Man on a different route which would appeal to more audiences.

The cartoon revolved around a 19 year old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire State University. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.68181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water based and was made for <a href=\"../../hydro-man/29-4457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydro-Man</a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Webb</a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel's popular super hero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving of the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world.

This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ's son, <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \" <a href=\"/counter-earth/4020-54572/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter Earth</a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson. Once on \"Counter Earth\", after almost being burned up on entry, Peter is under arrest and is sought out by <a href=\"../../lord-tyger/29-23429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lord Tyger</a> and the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a>. Spidey meets the people who are chasing him, known as the Knights of Wondergore. Lord Tyger introduces himself and the rest of the Knights of Wondergore; <a href=\"../../lady-ursula/29-14834/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ursula</a>, <a href=\"../../lady-vermin/29-23430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Vermin</a>, and <a href=\"../../sir-ram/29-14518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Ram</a>. While being chased throughout the city, he realizes that there is a high tech society where humanoid animals have taken over and the normal people live in the overpopulated slums. He was captured and told of what happened by the High Evolutionary who came from another planet to seek a place where petty humans squabbles; greed, selfishness, violence, and hatred was no more. He built his paradise with many experiments, using animals that he now calls Beastials. They are under the leadership of the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a>, are stronger, faster, and free of the primitive human mind. Spider-Man was rescued by the resistance who had been told that the war lasted for 50 years. Spidey finds John in the resistance deciding to stay until the humans are free of the High Evolutionary's oppression. Peter blends in with the humans to see what the \"Counter Earth\" world was like. After saving Shane Yamada-Jones from the robots, Naoko, Shane's mother, a doctor, helps Peter. He takes him into their home, providing Peter pays rent, giving him two weeks rent free for saving Shane's life. This series doesn't last long. Only thirteen episodes were broadcast ending with a cliffhanger. Six more episodes were made for the second season but were never aired.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/spider-man-the-new-animated-series/4075-217/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-217\">Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</a> (2003)</b></h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392484\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392484\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The New Animated Series\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/21919/392484-114808-spider-man.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>This series debuted on MTV and aired from July 11, 2003 through September 12, 2003.

He ends up stopping <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flint Marko</a> and <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex O' Hirn</a>.

The character designs resemble those of The Batman TV series, as they have been designed by the same people who worked on that show. This series is supposed to be like the 1960's version of Spider-Man. It doesn't start off like all of the other incarnations of Spider-Man, starting off with Peter getting bitten by a radioactive spider but with a twist. Peter just starts his junior yeah of high school and gets pushed around by jocks. He made friends in Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy is also Peters intellectual equal, getting a job working for Doctor Connors. Gwen and Peter also see their old friend Eddie Brock who Peters call bro because their parents were best friends. Both Eddie's and Peter's parents died in a plane crash. Ever since then, Eddie and Peter have had a close friendship. Peter betrays Doctor Connors trust by taking pictures of Spider-Man and Doctor Connors as the Lizard. This puts a strain on their friendship and their \"brotherhood\". Eddie knows about Gwen liking him but after all the things that he did wrong, it was the final straw when Peter goes to the prom with Mary Jane. This series is full of twists and turns. It ends its first season with Eddie being taken over by the symbiote and turning into Venom. After almost being beaten by Venom, he saves Gwen and continues to have a Thanksgiving dinner. Aunt May has come out of hospital after recovering from a heart attack, Peter cooks the thanksgiving dinner, Gwen brings over her family dinner and they all enjoy a nice meal. Peter washes the dishes and goes outside thanking Gwen for what she has done and for always being there.

Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original story lines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety</b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire</b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. However, in 1995 he made his fighting game debut in Capcom's<strong> Marvel Super Heroes</strong> arcade game (which was later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn). He returned for the 1997 sequel <strong>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</strong> (which later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn) and its 1998 followup, <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes </strong>(which was later ported to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\" data-ratio=\"0.69849246231156\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 597px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\"><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2</figcaption></figure><p>Not until 2000 would Spider-Man return in his own game. Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, as a character in a fighting game and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man</b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>Spider-Man</b>, developed by NeverSoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year, but lacked the full motion cut scenes due the systems hardware. Spider-Man was also one of the playable character in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes </strong>(which later was released on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Xbox). In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</b> as a hidden character. In 2001, sequels to the successful Activision titles were released. <b>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</b> for the PlayStation and <b>Spider-Man 2: Sinister Six</b> for the Gameboy Color. Spider-Man made an early appearance on Nintendo's new handheld system, the Gameboy Advance with <b>Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace</b>.

It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"../../spider-man-2/223-42/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 2</a> was released in June 2004, <strong>Spider-Man 2: The Game</strong> was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>Ultimate Spider-Man</b> followed many of the comic story arcs, and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</strong> and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M</a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man's latest film, <a href=\"../../spider-man-3/223-54/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 3</a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3</b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii , Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP and PC. <strong>Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</strong> was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2 , PC, PSP and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.</p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey's Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player's can dictate Spider-Man's actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a>, Mary Jane and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</strong> and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.</p><p>Spidey's next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing is crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end you battle a immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.</p><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\"><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey in action</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man once again featured as a playable fighter in the 2011 release of <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</strong> and its updated release of <strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</strong> and versions of the game would be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360. October 2011 also saw the release of the next Spider-Man video game adventure with <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time</b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free reign after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O'Hara. New villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter's death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple danger, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex. Currently Beenox has been given rights to the creation of all future Spider-Man games.</p><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.94272727272727\" data-width=\"1100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man is an unlockable character in the Facebook game <b>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</b>.

Because of his skills Bucky was sent to <a href=\"/england/4020-55794/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\">England</a> on his sixteenth birthday, where he went through two months of combat training with the British S.A.S. and another month of special training back in the United States. To his superiors Bucky was the best natural fighter they had ever seen. It wasn't long before he was made <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>'s partner, who unlike Cap could get his hands dirty doing the little tricks that Cap wasn't allowed to do because of regular military methods.</p><p>The press then came up with a cover story: \"Camp kid becomes Cap's sidekick,\" which made kids all over the country think it could happen to them too. He soon joined Cap as a member of the <a href=\"../../invaders/65-25865/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invaders</a>, fighting alongside such other heroes as <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> the Sub-Mariner, <a href=\"../../jim-hammond/29-12605/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Hammond</a> the Human Torch and Thomas Raymond the <a href=\"../../toro/29-11835/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toro</a>. As they were about the same age, Bucky and Toro would become close friends, along with the <a href=\"/human-top/4005-34751/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34751\">Human Top</a> and <a href=\"/golden-woman/4005-59034/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59034\">Golden Girl</a>, who dubbed themselves \"The Kid Commandos\". During this time he teamed up with other sidekicks to form the <a href=\"../../young-allies/65-40515/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Young Allies</a> and later the <a href=\"../../liberty-legion/65-44574/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liberty Legion</a> to help the Invaders in their fight against the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>. Bucky also teamed-up with a group of teenage superheroes called the <a href=\"/kid-commandos/4060-56332/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56332\">Kid Commandos</a>.</p><p>In the closing days of World War II, during a mission overseas to take down <a href=\"../../baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a>, Cap and Bucky hopped on a plane carrying a bomb and hoping to disarm it. Cap couldn't reach it but Bucky hung on. It was booby trapped and the bomb detonated. Bucky found himself too close to the explosion which sent him and Captain America falling into the waters below. While Captain America's body was frozen in a state of suspended animation for years, Bucky's body was never found... Or was it?</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"../../joe-simon/26-9443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe Simon</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a> created Bucky Barnes as a sidekick for Captain America, named after a childhood friend of Joe Simon's. He first appeared in <a href=\"../../captain-america-comics/49-1628/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America Comics</a> #1 in March 1941.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Bucky has been through some drastic changes in his career.</p><h3>Golden Age</h3><p>Bucky was a major feature of the Golden Age of comics as Captain America's sidekick, although the decline in superhero comics in the late 1940's saw him replaced by <a href=\"../../golden-girl/29-34752/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Betsy Ross</a> (Golden Girl) as Captain America's partner. A brief revival in the early 50's sadly fizzled and the character was left dormant after <a href=\"../../captain-america-comics/49-1628/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a> #78 in September 1954.</p><h3>Silver Age</h3><p>When Captain America returned in the pages of <a href=\"../../the-avengers/49-2128/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Avengers</a> #4, the first retcon was made to Bucky's history, revealing that he and Captain America met their fatal end at the close of <a href=\"/world-war-ii/4015-56025/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56025\">World War II</a> in an airplane explosion, and that subsequent appearances of the two were actually stand-in heroes posing as Cap and Bucky. However, despite Captain America returning as a mainstream Marvel hero, Bucky was left apparently permanently dead for many years to the extent that it was assumed he would never be revived (a la <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>'s <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben</a>). Instead, Bucky appeared in flashbacks and in tales of his and Cap's World War II history together (for example in <a href=\"../../the-invaders/49-2765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Invaders</a> series).</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p><a href=\"../../ed-brubaker/26-41468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ed Brubaker</a> finally brought Bucky back to real life when he restored him in another retcon, this time showing how he had become the Winter Soldier. This path has since led to Bucky replacing Steve Rogers as Captain America in the Marvel Universe.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Winter Soldier</h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77160\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/77160-67291-winter-soldier.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/77160-67291-winter-soldier.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77160\"><img alt=\"Bucky as Winter Soldier\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77160-67291-winter-soldier.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77160-67291-winter-soldier.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Bucky as Winter Soldier</figcaption></figure><p>In April 1945, an experimental Soviet spy-submarine helmed by Comrade Karpov was crossing the English Channel when it intercepted a transmission claiming that Captain America and Bucky had been blown up. Not far from the area, the sub quickly charted the depths and discovered Bucky's tattered body, his left arm completely torn off. Apparently flash-frozen in the waters, the Soviets slowly increased his temperature to thaw out his tissues. After administering electricity, CPR and adrenaline directly into his heart, Bucky was brought back from the dead. While he had no memory of his previous life, Bucky demonstrated a remarkable ability: reflex memories. He knew how to fight, and how to speak four languages, but had no clue how he knew all this.</p><p>Fitting him with a cybernetic arm, the Soviets began work on the Winter Soldier Project. They began mental implantation to reprogram his mind and make him loyal to no one but the Soviets. With the codename Winter Soldier, the former Bucky was sent out on spy missions to blend in with his surroundings and assassinate various Cold War power-players. After acting oddly on a few missions, Bucky served as a body guard to the professor behind the Winter Soldier project for a few years before the Soviets decided to store the Winter Soldier away in a suspended state until needed again, keeping his mind from learning the truth.</p><p>Bucky's memory loss was so severe that even after killing a number of subjects including <a href=\"../../red-skull/2250/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Skull</a> and <a href=\"../../nomad/7618/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nomad</a> under the direction of Karpov's protégée, <a href=\"../../aleksander-lukin/29-40820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aleksander Lukin</a>, the Winter Soldier came face to face with Captain America and still did not remember his past at all.</p><p>Under orders from Lukin, Bucky is told to bring the newly obtained <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\">Cosmic Cube</a> to a safe location. However, using <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M.</a> technology Captain America and <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon</a> are able to track Bucky down and after a close battle, resulting in Captain America obtaining the all-powerful <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube</a>. Cap held the Cube and made one short statement to the Winter Soldier: \"Remember who you are.\" As the memories flooded back to him, the Winter Soldier couldn't handle it and destroyed the Cube, vanishing with it. Although the rest believe Bucky to be dead as a result of the splash damage from the cube, Captain America believed that he was alive, referring to Bucky as a \"fighter\". This is indeed true, as Bucky is revealed to have been teleported by the cube to his old air base where he first met <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Steve Rogers</a>. He soon found an ally in <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a>, another WWII legend who has also gone 'off the map'. Fury equipped Bucky with the Intel and equipment (including an improved cybernetic arm) needed to remain a key player behind the scenes of the Marvel Universe.</p><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-986469\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.63859649122807\" data-width=\"570\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-986469\"><img alt=\"Bucky is unable to accept what he has become\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg 570w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bucky is unable to accept what he has become\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg 570w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/16263/986469-413273_0001hk6g_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bucky is unable to accept what he has become</figcaption></figure><p>Confused, angry and still reeling from shock of Steve's death, Bucky looked for a way to strike back. After getting into a bar fight and being the only man left standing Bucky decides that the only way to strike back is to kill Tony Stark, blaming him for the death of Steve Rogers. He stole Cap's shield during a transfer between two <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> holding areas. This leads him to a confrontation with Natasha Romanov aka <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a>, who is revealed to also be an old flame of his. Bucky is able to defeat Natasha with ease, having trained her, and goes on to ambush the Red Skull, who is revealed to be alive and currently sharing a mind with <a href=\"/aleksander-lukin/4005-40820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40820\">Lukin</a>. Bucky succeeds in infiltrating Lukin's office and defeating both <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones</a> and <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\">Sin</a> but before he can pull the trigger Lukin speaks the word \"sputnik\" (a word implanted in him to shut him down during his time as the Winter Soldier) which causes Bucky to be unconscious and only to be temporarily taken prisoner. Bucky is taken to be brainwashed by <a href=\"../../dr-faustus/29-34185/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Faustus</a> so he can be used by the Red Skull but Bucky manages to escape and attempts to rescue Sharon Carter who unknown to him is under Faustus control. Bucky is taken on-board a ship where Faustus attempts to escape from the coming S.H.I.E.L.D units and the Falcon who is in close pursuit. Gaining momentary sanity Sharon throws Bucky overboard knowing that the Falcon will save him and allowing him to be held by S.H.I.E.L.D custody.</p><h3>The New Captain America</h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-295919\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.415\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-295919\"><img alt=\"Captain America Returns!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain America Returns!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/295919-49583-bucky-barnes.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain America Returns!</figcaption></figure><p>Steve Rogers left instructions for <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tony Stark</a> in a letter written before his death to \"save\" Bucky and that the mantle of Captain America should go on. After the murder of Steve Rogers, the man who was Captain America, Cap's former partner during World War II, James \"Bucky\" Barnes, agreed to don the mantle. And even as he struggles with the sins he committed as the Winter Soldier - the Soviet mercenary he was brainwashed into becoming during the Cold War - the new Captain America finds his past as both Bucky and the Winter Soldier colliding with his present.</p><p>When the Winter Soldier (Bucky) was brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, he managed to escape. His cybernetic arm had been removed and was being examined by S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. They were surprised at how much of their own design was in place. Either the Russians had a mole in S.H.I.E.L.D. or the Winter Soldier was working for Nick Fury. The arm sent out an electrical shock to one scientist, rose up and knocked out the other two. It then crawled up the wall and into a ventilation shaft to seek out it's owner. When the Winter Soldier was free his only goal was to attack Iron Man.</p><p>The two fought to a standstill until Stark mentioned the letter from Steve. Bucky wasn't sure that Cap had meant for him to actually become Captain America. Tony said that there's no way Bucky would let anyone else fill those boots and asked if he wanted to be the one to let Steve down. Bucky said he'd do it under two conditions. The first was that his mind was completely probed to ensure there was no trace of brainwashing or fail safe code-words left over from when he was under control was the Winter Soldier. The second condition is that he doesn't have to answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. or to Stark, just as Steve didn't. Tony thought about it and agreed. Bucky donned his own new Captain America costume as he did not feel right wearing Steve's. On his first mission Bucky with Black Widow at his side fight an A.I.M radical group to which he easily defeats. He is later confronted while training with the shield by Clint Barton aka Hawkeye who does not approve of him being the new Captain America. Clint attempts to fight Bucky who merely blocks his attacks. Upon learning that they were basically thought the same moves Clint departs warning Bucky not to let the name of Captain America down. After the revealing of a jaded <a href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\">former Captain America</a> Bucky goes to confront him despite being told by the <a href=\"../../falcon/29-1451/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcon</a> not to. Bucky sneaks into a room to find information only to be taken by surprise by this Cap and is punched through a wall. The Captain America from the 1950s is able to defeat Bucky resulting in him getting thrown of a building but saved by the Falcon just in time. The two later knowing that the red skull will want to retrieve the 50s Cap use him as bait to gain the location of the Red Skulls base.</p><h3>A New Avenger</h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-657159\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5232558139535\" data-width=\"602\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 602px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-657159\"><img alt=\"Joining the New Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-width=\"630\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg 602w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Joining the New Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/25835/657159-new_avengers_048_013.jpg 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-width=\"630\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Joining the New Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Since becoming Captain America, Bucky has stopped the Red Skull's plans and saved the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, winning public applause.

They send in <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a> to try and join Norman's <a href=\"../../dark-avengers/65-55990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> into a trap, but Norman figures out this plan and sends <a href=\"../../the-hood/29-41917/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hood</a> and his <a href=\"../../the-hoods-gang/65-50921/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gang</a> to try and take the New Avengers down, the Avengers make their way out of the ambush and try to think of a new plan.</p><p>One night Bucky was up late talking to Black Widow about what he did as the Winter Soldier, Widow kept telling him that it wasn't his fault, he went out to think but ran into Batroc, they fought but Bucky was defeated. Later, he and Widow went to the U.N. to find some answers, but discover that the U.N. is covering something up. Bucky then goes to the black market to find answers, learning that the U.N. would be transporting something the next day. The next day Bucky ran into Batroc again trying to steal what ever the U.N. was transporting, they began to fight, then <a href=\"../../the-man-with-no-face/29-62217/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Man With No Face</a> jumped into the fight, Bucky defeated Batroc, but even with the help from Black Widow, The Man With No Face got away with what was left of the Original Human Torch.</p><p>James teams up with Namor and goes after The Man with No Face and Professor Chin (the man who created The Man with No Face), while Black Widow works on getting more info on this Professor Chin. Cap and Namor use Namor's old ship to sneak into Professor Chin's base and they split up but Namor is captured. James then changes into his old Winter Soldier uniform and makes his way through the base, Professor Chin begins to experiment on Namor while Black Widow makes her way to Namor's ship and sees that James is not wearing his Captain America uniform. James breaks into Chin's lab and orders Chin to let Namor go, but The Man with No Face attacks James. During the battle Chin injects Namor with some kind of chemical, but Namor is unaffected because of him Mutant-Human gene. Black Widow then joins in the fight and helps James beat The Man with No Face, as well as helps both James and Namor to escape. While on their way home, Namor mentions how good of a team James and Natalia make. Back home Namor, Norman Osborn, and others put the Human Torch to rest and James later comes to grave to pay his respects to an old friend.</p><p>On his birthday, Bucky was on patrol above the streets of New York City, when he was suddenly attacked by a group of rocket men. As he ran across the rooftops, dodging heat-seeking missiles in the process, he was able to get a picture of his attackers and sent it to <a href=\"../../hawkeye/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clint Barton</a>, asking Barton to find out who these guys were and why they were trying to kill him. While this was happening Bucky started to remember other birthdays he's had over the years, the first of which involved him getting into a fight after getting drunk on his 16th birthday. Next was his 18th birthday when, during which Toro tried to get him a cake and accidentally gave away their position to the Nazis, whom the group had to fight off. In 1945, when he turned 20, Bucky spent his birthday helping Steve interrogate a German spy. During his time as Winter Soldier he didn't celebrate any birthdays. Clint Barton was able to find out that Bucky's attackers were members of a militia group called the <a href=\"../../the-watchdogs/65-55768/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watchdogs</a>, a team of so-called patriots who claimed to worship Captain America. As Bucky fought The Watchdogs, he saved a lady and her child from one of the rogue missiles. After taking down two of the men out with his shield, Bucky shot the third, after which he questions the man on why they are trying to kill him. The Watchdog responds by telling him that he he isn't the real Captain America. Bucky then tells the militiaman he knows, but that he is trying. When he returned home, Bucky was surprised by a birthday party that Black Widow and the New Avengers had made for him.</p><h3>Captain America: Reborn</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845316\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png\" data-ratio=\"0.5919881305638\" data-width=\"674\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 674px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-845316\"><img alt=\"Captain America and Black Widow\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 674w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain America and Black Widow\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 674w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/39027/845316-bucky_cap_and_black_widow.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain America and Black Widow</figcaption></figure><p>On the one year anniversary of Steve Rogers' death, Bucky, along with his fellow Avengers went together to the vigil in Steve's honor.

The judge declares Bucky to be innocent but Russian officials come to take Bucky back to Russia where he has been convicted of crime against the state.</p><h3>Gulag and Fear Itself</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462485\" data-ratio=\"1.5670910871694\" data-width=\"1021\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1021px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462485\"><img alt=\"Bucky seemingly perishes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 1021w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 612w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bucky seemingly perishes\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 1021w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 612w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462485-4277707750-Fear%2B.JPG 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bucky seemingly perishes</figcaption></figure><p>While in the <a href=\"../../captain-america-gulag-part-2/37-269012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gulag</a>, Bucky starts finding old memories brought to life.

Bucky was brought to the Gulag as a plot by Colonel Andre Rostov (Red Barbarian) to extract information from his mind regarding the location and activation codes for three additional sleeper agents that were trained by Bucky and hidden within the United States. Once the codes were extracted, Bucky was forced to fight Unicorn in the arena. Bucky continually evades the blasts from Unicorn's third eye until he maneuvers in front of the methane tanks which are blown up destroying much of the Gulag. Bucky makes his escape of the burning prison to find that Black Widow was there with a helicopter ready to break him out. During <a href=\"../../fear-itself-the-hammer-that-fell-on-yancy-street/37-272330/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fear Itself</a> , Bucky has returned to the States as Captain America to face Sin, the new Red Skull and now Skadi, in Washington.

They have a briefing in the morning with <a href=\"/jasper-sitwell/4005-7529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7529\">Jasper Sitwell</a> who tells them about a former KGB agent named Nico Stanovich, who went in hiding and is perhaps the handler of the awoken sleeper agent. Bucky and Natasha head to Minnesota where they meet another former KGB agent of the same squad named Mikel Bulgakov. They interrogate Bulgakov until he gives them the little info he knows about the sleepers' activation codes which he sold to some unknown buyers and the next sleeper. Bucky and Natasha go the warehouse location and dispatch the agents in there. They get assaulted by a genetically modified gorilla with a chain gun and after a brief battle, the gorilla flies off. They head back for another briefing and find the activated sleeper, while Nick Fury gives them some intel on an infiltration mission at an auction. Bucky starts a raid and him and Nat defeat the goons there and get more info on the buyer of the codes who also happened to buy a doombot. They narrow down the possible people who want to use these agents and bot to start a war between the U.S. and Latveria to <a href=\"/lucia-von-bardas/4005-61288/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61288\">Lucia Von Bardas</a>. In order to get help and prevent a war, Bucky and Natasha infiltrate <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom's</a> fortress who attacks them in confusion until Bucky tells him to stop and someone is trying to frame him with the Doombot.</p><p>Bucky and Dr. Doom face off against the Doombot and Arkady, a sleeper agent. Bucky ends up killing Arkady. Bucky, Doom and Natasha infiltrate Doom's hidden missile silo where Von Bardas is located. Bucky runs off and defeats Dimitri. Natasha tells Bucky about intel that Agent Sitwell had. The intel was about the person who sold the codes to the Zephyr Sleepers. That person was Colonel Andre Rostov (Red Barbarian) Ex-Soviot Agent. Bucky then tracks him down in the Bahamas and assassinates him by sniper shot.</p><h3>Broken Arrow</h3><p>Bucky investigates the final sleeper agent's stasis pod location and learns he has been broken out for some time. They learn his name is <a href=\"/leo-novokov/4005-86574/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86574\">Leo Novokov</a>. To locate the sleeper, Bucky decides to check the newspapers because controllers used secret classified ads to find the agents and find a handler was killed. <a href=\"/fred-davis/4005-22647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22647\">Fred Davis</a>, the one time Bucky stand in, was killed Leo causing Bucky and Natasha to investigate allowing Leo to find Bucky to begin his revenge. Novokov kidnaps Professor Rodchenko who was a former Red Room Russian scientist that specialized in brainwashing. Bucky and Natasha locate Novokov on a stolen bus and intercept it on a mountain highway. After a shoot out, Novokov flees the bus which is loaded down with explosives. Natasha follows Novokov while Bucky drives the bus off an overlook to explode harmlessly after he jumped out at the last moment. Novokov set the whole instance up to separate Natasha from Bucky where he kidnaps her.</p><p>Bucky and Agent Sitwell search for clues on where Leonid has taken Natasha while it is revealed that he has brainwashed her and set her up to be a ballerina. Bucky and Sitwell are able to locate her at a private performance for the First Lady of the United States and members of the press. After seeing to the evacuation of the crowd, Bucky engages the brainwashed Black Widow in an attempt to get her to be released from the brainwashing effects. Leonid opens fire upon them causing Bucky to leave his fight and attack Leo head on. After a brief fight, Leo points out that Natasha was about to kill Sitwell. Bucky stops Natasha from shooting and she remembers who she is, but Leo is able to escape. Bucky tracks down where the Professor is being kept captive while Natasha is taken back to the Helicarrier for a medical analysis. When Bucky finds the Professor, he is informed that there is more Leo's plan and that Natasha was still under Leo's control.</p><h3>Widow Hunt</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462483\" data-ratio=\"1.4922222222222\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462483\"><img alt=\"Widow Hunt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" data-width=\"428\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 643w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 428w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Widow Hunt\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 643w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462483-2294038532-Winte.jpg 428w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px\" data-width=\"428\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Widow Hunt</figcaption></figure><p>While on the Helicarrier, a second layer of programming kicks in for Natasha and she attacks Nick Fury, Sitwell, and the SHIELD agents on board. She is about to kill Fury when Sitwell steps in front of the gun and takes the fatal bullets. Natasha flees the Helicarrier on a flying motorcycle and vanishes without a trace. During interrogation with Professor Rodchenko, Bucky finds out that all memories of his relationship with Natasha has been removed from her memory. He is trying to cope with this information when Captain America arrives and lets him know that they are going to find her along with Hawkeye, Wolverine, and Maria Hill. Bucky and Hawkeye head research where Novokov is headed next. They find a spot where they get attacked by AIM agents and they make short work of them. Bucky and Clint enter a building where they find a hard drive with a message from Novokov saying if Bucky ever wants to see Natasha again, he will take the hard drive and have Professor Rodchenko install it in his head.</p><p>Bucky is attempted to be talked out of the mission but by Hill and Hawkeye, but he manages to escape them and breaks Rodchenko out of jail to install the mission. The installment is successful which reverts Barnes back to his original days as the Winter Soldier. Bucky turns on the professor and uses the memory machine on him to erase his mind. Bucky is trailed by Wolverine and Hawkeye and manages to escape by cheap shooting on Logan and utilizing the environment to his advantage. It is revealed the mission is for Bucky to target Daredevil whom is someone Natasha cares about. Bucky finds Daredevil and they fight him. Wolverine, Captain America and Hawkeye join in and they knock Barnes out and bring him back to S.H.I.E.L.D where they manage to piece his memory back together. The team then heads out to find Novokov and retrieve Black Widow.</p><p>Bucky and the team learn that Leo has planted a bomb somewhere and learn of three locations. They each scatter taking one location with James heading out on his own. He finds the bomb along with Leo and Natasha. Natasha discovers him and Bucky faces off against the two. He tries to avoid harming Natasha and focuses his assault on Leo and manages to beat him down. S.H.I.E.L.D sends <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, and Cap along with plenty of reinforcements to the bomb site where Leo attempts to hold Widow hostage. Hawkeye manages to separate them allowing Bucky to shoot Novokov. S.H.I.E.L.D manages to resuscitate Leo and they manage to connect all of Widow's memories back together up to current time except for one; the one about Bucky. S.H.I.E.L.D attempts to continue fixing Widow, but Bucky screams at them to stop messing with her head as she has suffered enough. Bucky looks in on Natasha's room saying at least only he has to suffer these feelings as he walks away heartbroken with the realization Leo had truly won.</p><h4>The Man On the Wall</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462481\" data-ratio=\"1.3744292237443\" data-width=\"438\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 438px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4462481\"><img alt=\"Bucky Barnes: Cosmic Assassin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg 438w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bucky Barnes: Cosmic Assassin\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg 438w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4462481-0975703069-bucky.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bucky Barnes: Cosmic Assassin</figcaption></figure><p>During the events of<a href=\"/original-sin/4045-57800/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-57800\"><em> Original Sin</em></a>, Bucky is contacted by a mysterious voice after <a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Uatu the Watcher </a>is murdered. It is revealed that the original Nick Fury is dying due to the Infinity Serum having run out, and is seeking to find someone to replace him in his role as \"The Man On the Wall\", Earth's secret defense against cosmic and otherworldly threats. Bucky is chosen as a candidate alongside<a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\"> Black Panther</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"/gamora/4005-6806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6806\">Gamora</a>, <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Ant-Man</a>, the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> and <a href=\"/moon-knight/4005-1493/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\">Moon Knight</a>, and ultimately becomes the new protector of Earth after Fury seemingly perishes.</p><p>He recruits <a href=\"/quake/4005-43174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43174\">Quake</a> (who had been fired from S.H.I.E.L.D.) to act as his new partner, with the two stealthily eliminating potential threats to Earth before they even have a chance to strike.</p><h2>Powers, Abilities and Equipment</h2><p>Bucky is not like Steve, he did not take a Super Soldier Serum, though Bucky is classified as peak human.</p><p>Bucky Barnes also has a left Cybernetic Arm that has a significant amount of strength (capable of throwing a shield through guns and steel super computers), it is also capable of producing EMP's and electrical shocks. He has recently been injected with the Infinity Formula by Nick Fury, in order to save Bucky. Whether or not this has any effect on his physical abilities beyond great longevity remains to be seen.</p><h4>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe</h4><p>In the recent Captain America Films, it is apparent that Arnim Zola’s experiments, and the additional rigors of Hydra’s manipulations have resulted in Bucky’s physical attributes reaching meta-human levels. In “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”, we see that his non-cybernetic strength is comparable to Captain America's, as we observe him kick a SHIELD operative 30 feet through the air (into a QuinJet Turbine). We can also assume that his agility and reflexes have also been similarly enhanced, since he continued to be a formidable challenge for Cap in hand to hand combat, while we see Cap easily defeat Batroc the Leaper, who is a highly trained fighter, with exceptional ‘human’ physical prowess levels. It can also be deduced that Bucky’s running speed is slightly faster than Cap’s since both he and the Black Panther out-ran Steve during the chase in Berlin, in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.</p><h3>Fighting Ability</h3><p>As a young teenager, James was observed to have remarkable fighting prowess by fighting military men twice his size and age. Concerned, the U.S. Army decided to make use of James fighting ability and immediately sent him off to train with the British SAS. Upon returning, he continued his training under William Essart Fairbairn and Colonel Rex Applegate to become Bucky, the sidekick to Captain America (Steve Rogers).</p><p>As Bucky, he was further trained by Steve Rogers until his death and rebirth into the Russian assassin known as the Winter Soldier.</p><p>With no prior memory of his former self except for his fighting ability, the Winter Soldier continued to train under the Russians to harness his skill in martial arts and assassinations. Because of his skill, James became the basis for the Red Room program and trained dozens of other Russian assassins including the Black Widow.</p><p>Bucky has proven his fighting ability against creditable fighters such as Black Widow, Sin, Crossbones, Batroc the Leaper, Wolverine and more. Although he has doubted himself by comparing his physical ability to Steve's super soldier abilities (Approximately 3 times stronger and faster than himself), with his lack of super soldier formula and ability to go toe to toe against many of Steve’s rogues and win proves that he is on a level close to Steve's fighting ability.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>Bucky, like many others, looks up to Steve Rogers. He has a great deal of respect for Steve, but Bucky is also ashamed of what he has done as Winter Soldier. Bucky has shown signs of aggression whilst depressed and has also redeveloped a relationship with Black Widow. But he is also sarcastic and makes jokes like his light-hearted self.</p><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1216736\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.89981096408318\" data-width=\"1058\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1058px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1216736\"><img alt=\"Bucky's bionic arm emitting an electrical charge\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 1058w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bucky's bionic arm emitting an electrical charge\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 1058w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39027/1216736-captain_america_46_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bucky's bionic arm emitting an electrical charge</figcaption></figure><p>As the Winter Soldier he has super strength and quick reaction time and the ability to produce EMPs, as well as jammers for metal detectors and x-ray machines, due to his cyborg left arm. Even when this arm is removed, Winter Soldier can mentally control it from a remote location. His time as a covert Soviet agent has further honed his skills giving him a combination of mix fighting styles for use in close combat. As the Winter Soldier, Barnes became an expert assassin and spy and performed many behind the scenes assassinations without getting caught making some of his kills look like accidents. Thanks to Nick Fury, Bucky's bionic arm is now covered in a flesh like material making it both look and feel like a real arm.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As the Winter Soldier, James's missing arm was replaced by a cybernetic enhancement. As his career progressed as Captain America, Nick Fury found it necessary to upgrade his arm to be fully synthetic in order to look and feel real.</p><p>The arm is capable of the following:</p><ul><li>When detached, can be controlled by James through mental implants.</li><li>Capable of punching through metal and throwing a shield fast enough to slice through human limbs, control panels and assault rifles.</li><li>Capable of emitting a electrical shocks.</li><li>Capable of emitting an EMP to shut down electrical hardware.</li><li>Capable of bypassing any airport sensor.</li><li>Holographic imaging to appear as a normal human arm. Looks and feels like a human arm.</li></ul><p>As Captain America, James also carried the famous indestructible Vibranium-steel alloy shield and a modified handgun. The handgun closely resembles Nick Fury's modified handgun and has been commented by Mockingbird to fire greater impacting bullets than normal handguns. Ares has also been winded by being tricked and shot under the chin by Bucky. Bucky's gun has palm-print sensors so if anyone other than Bucky were to try and shoot the gun it would explode.</p><p>As the post-Cold War Winter Soldier, Bucky has an updated Winter Soldier BDU and gear:</p><ul><li>Impact resistant.</li><li>Bullet resistant.</li><li>Security jamming built in. The suit continues to give off a pulse which continuously jams and loops all recording devices for a few seconds.</li></ul><h2>Personal Data</h2><ul><li><b>Real Name:</b> James Buchanan Barnes</li><li><b>Aliases:</b> The Winter Soldier; formerly <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, Bucky</li><li><b>Identity:</b> Known to top level K.G.B. and <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>. authorities</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> United States</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Shelbyville, Indiana</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, Soviet assassin, freelance assassin, sidekick to <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>. army mascot</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> George M.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Arnim Zola was a biochemist whose knowledge of genetics was enhanced by his study of deviant science. He has no powers of his own but has achieved much though his own technology and ambition.</p><p>Zola was hired by the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a> to reverse-engineer some of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>'s technology so that he could separate his consciousness from <a href=\"/aleksander-lukin/4005-40820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40820\">Aleksander Lukin</a>'s by aging <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\">Sharon Carter</a>'s child and placing his mind into the body. Sharon was able to break free from the device and kill Lukin, but as a fail safe Zola had the Skull's mind transport to one of his android bodies in the event of Lukin's death. Zola was killed by a mentally unstable <a href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\">Grand Director</a> but it is believed that his mind was teleported to another android body.</p><p>Arnim Zola's orignal body was killed years ago. Since then he simply moves his consciousness from one android body to another.</p><p>Arnim has made his return in the recent Marvel Now Captain America comic, ruling his own \"Dimention Z\" which he has filled with many of his own strange creations. He captured Captain America and tried to perform experiments on him for an as of yet unknown purpose.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Arnim Zola was created by <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"/captain-america/4050-2400/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2400\">Captain America</a> # 208.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Arnim Zola possesses the ability to mentally control his various genetic creations by means of the ESP Box mounted atop his torso and surgically attached to his central nervous system. Although most of the creatures possess limited intelligence and the capacity for creative thought, Zola can override their mental processes if he so desires. The ESP Box is a retractable device that can convert brain waves into electronic signals for transmission as telepathic commands within ordinary radio range. Normally, Zola is capable of controlling only his own organic creations, but if he remains linked to his support equipment, he can stimulate his own mental power to such a degree that he can create a psychonkinetic network able to animate inorganic matter within radio range. Zola is unable to control natural organic life.</p><p>Where Arnim Zola's head should be is located in a device called the ESP Box. This device allows him to gain mental control of others, fire mental blasts or even transfer his consciousness into another android body.</p><p>Arnim Zola regularly has a number of super-powered androids that he can call upon to serve him.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Ultimate</h3><p>In <a href=\"/ultimate-enemy/4050-31298/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31298\">Ultimate Enemy</a>, Arnim Zola is a member of <a href=\"/roxxon/4060-56010/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon</a> Corp's brain trust.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><a href=\"/captain-america-the-first-avenger/4025-927/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-927\">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864168\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6656\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 625px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864168\"><img alt=\"Toby Jones as Arnim Zola\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg 625w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/59326/1864168-captainamericaphotosmall4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Toby Jones as Arnim Zola</figcaption></figure><p>In the 2011 film, Arnim Zola, played by <a href=\"/toby-jones/4040-81766/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-81766\">Toby Jones</a>, is a meek scientist working for the Red Skull's <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Kamala Khan is the youngest of two children from a traditional Pakistani Family in New Jersey. Despite her traditional roots, Kamala was the typical American teenager. Wanting to be herself, but still make her family proud. For several years, Kamala was a fan of superheroes especially the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and, more importantly, <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a>. So much, in fact, that she started writing online fan-fiction about the Avengers and Captain Marvel. Even going as far as joining the Carol Danvers Corps online.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Kamala Khan was created by Kelly Sue DeConnick and Scott Hepburn and first appeared (in a cameo) in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel-14-the-enemy-within-part-five-of-fi/4000-419965/\">Captain Marvel Vol.4 issue 14 </a>(2013) before appearing fully in issue 17 of the same series. She first appeared as the new Ms. Marvel in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/allnew-marvel-now-point-one/4050-70702/\">All-New Marvel Now! Point One</a> before receiving her own series. Kamala Khan has become something of a hit, being an American Muslim girl portrayed in a positive way.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Something more than Human</h3><p>It was during a high school party that Kamala decided to try and fit in with the \"regular crowd\" that Kamala realised that it wasn't for her. She left the party abruptly and on her way home was encased by the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\">Terrigen Mists</a> that were released during <a href=\"/infinity/4045-57167/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-57167\">Infinity</a> revealing that Kamala was a descendant of the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>. Encased in a cocoon, her Inhuman powers developed. Kamala was put in a dream like state where a dream avatar of Captain Marvel asked her: \"Who do you want to be?\" Kamala replied: \"I want to be you.\" In doing so, she burst from the cocoon looking exactly like Carol in her old black unitard costume. After a panic, Kamala learned she had gained shape shifting powers. Able to change her appearance or parts of her body at will. She eventually changed back to her own appearance and took on the identity of the all-new, Ms. Marvel intending to be a superhero like Carol.</p><h3>Meeting Spider-Man</h3><p>Kamala intercepted <a href=\"/dr-minerva/4005-26673/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26673\">Dr. Minerva</a> when she was attempting a kidnapping of a new Inhuman (Nuhuman), this also was the first time Ms. Marvel ever meets <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>. The pair would go toe to toe with Dr. Minerva who revealed that she was able to alter her powers from that of the original Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers, and could now change into a gigantic monster. This was also the first time Kamala had ever faced anything as horrific as this and with Spider-Man's help she was able to defeat Dr. Minerva, save the Nuhuman which turned out to be a baby and even get some praise from Spider-Man.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3977508-ms.%20marvel%20-%20kamala%20khan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3977508\" data-ratio=\"1.51875\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3977508-ms.%20marvel%20-%20kamala%20khan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3977508\"><img alt=\"Kamala Khan in full costume\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3977508-ms.%20marvel%20-%20kamala%20khan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3977508-ms.%20marvel%20-%20kamala%20khan.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3977508-ms.%20marvel%20-%20kamala%20khan.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></a><figcaption>Kamala Khan in full costume</figcaption></figure><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5900327\" data-ratio=\"0.67655935613682\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5900327\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg 1988w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11132/111321728/5900327-rco015_1497486598.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Although Kamala has the same superhero alias as previously Danvers did, her powers are not similar to the blonde bombshell. Kamala is a polymorph after being exposed to the Terrigen Mist. This gives her the ability to stretch her body in almost anyway imaginable. Kamala can also increase and decrease her size to both gigantic and tiny sizes. The limits of this ability has yet to be revealed but she has grown large enough to handle a car and shrunk to the size of a cockroach. She can also selectively increase and decrease the size of any part of her body, although she prefers to increase the size of her fists. But she also uses the ability to increase the length of her legs so that she can travel great distances in a short amount of time. Kamala also has the ability to shape-shift. In theory she can look like anyone she wants, but so far she has only changed into Carol Danvers and her own mother. Kamala also has healing abilities since she has been shot in the stomach but was able to heal over the wound when she transformed back to her original form. She cannot transform again until the healing process is complete.</p><h3>Weaknesses</h3><p>The power of an electromagnetic pulse can cause her powers to be temporarily disabled. She discovered this while fighting The Inventor.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Exiles</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7188867\" data-ratio=\"1.4432432432432\" data-width=\"740\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 740px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.3%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7188867\"><img alt=\"Khan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 740w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 665w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 443w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Khan\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 740w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 665w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188867-khan.jpg 443w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" data-width=\"443\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Khan</figcaption></figure><p>A much older version of Ms. Marvel, known only as Khan, appears in the 2018 <em>Exiles</em> series. This iteration of the character hails from a timeline where much of the Earth was destroyed during a conflict between Inhumans, <a href=\"/x-gene-mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">Mutants</a> and <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a>. After <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\">Sabretooth</a> killed her husband and daughter, Khan was left embittered and cynical, eventually becoming the leader of a group of surviving Inhumans in the ruins of New Jersey. Khan became involved with the Exiles after Blink ended up in her world, which was quickly destroyed by the Time Eater. With no world to call her own, Khan joins the Exiles (consisting of <a href=\"/blink/4005-12548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12548\">Blink</a>, <a href=\"/iron-lad/4005-2263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2263\">Iron Lad</a>, <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Valkyrie</a> and <a href=\"/wolvie/4005-46802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46802\">Wolvie</a>), and eventually sacrifices herself to save her teammates. She later returns, revealing that the Watchers pulled her out of the timeline and offered to take her to a reality where her family was still alive if she stopped the Exiles. She is given command of her own team of cross-dimensional characters, consisting of villainous versions of <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"/shuri/4005-58997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58997\">Shuri</a>, Nathaniel Richards, <a href=\"/x-23/4005-3560/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3560\">X-23</a> and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, and is sent to capture her former teammates. She ultimately relents after Wolvie causes her to realize that her daughter would be ashamed of Khan's actions. She reappears one last time in the finale, where she reveals that she was reunited with her family due to Iron Lad's sacrifice.</p><h3>Secret Wars</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7188876\" data-ratio=\"0.64175257731959\" data-width=\"388\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 388px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.2%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7188876\"><img alt=\"Agent of Attilan\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.png 388w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Agent of Attilan\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.png 388w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7188876-kamala%203.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Agent of Attilan</figcaption></figure><p>In the Manhattan region of <a href=\"/battleworld/4020-51065/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-51065\">Battleworld</a>, an alternate version of Kamala was one of <a href=\"/medusa/4005-4327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4327\">Medusa</a>'s spies from <a href=\"/new-attilan/4020-59866/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-59866\">New Attilan</a>.

Obadiah used his agents, the Chessmen, to attack James Rhodes ( <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">War Machine</a>). He also placed the Chessmen's Queen <a href=\"../../indries-moomji/29-32191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indries Moomji</a> to become Stark's lover. Stark later became aware of Stane's involvement in his friend's attack but was unable to do anything because of a serious alcoholic relapse. He later bought Stark International thanks to <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a> (changing the name of the company to Stane International) and began manufacturing weapons for the agency and other organizations with which he established military contracts. Stark gave his armor to Rhodey and became a homeless vagrant. Despite this, Tony maintained plans for a new <a href=\"../../iron-man-armor/18-50749/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man Armor</a>. With help from a team of scientists, Stane created the Iron Monger armor which was more powerful than even Stark's own. Using the Iron Monger as a corporate mascot, Stane planned to sell the armor to the highest bidder, or produce an entire army of armors which could be used to conquer whole countries. It was also during this time that Stane formed an alliance with <a href=\"../../madame-masque/29-13940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Masque</a>, another adversary to Iron Man of the <a href=\"../../maggia/65-26082/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maggia</a> crime family.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h4>The Death of Stane</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313852\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2396694214876\" data-width=\"242\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 242px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:124.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313852\"><img alt=\"Iron Man vs Iron Monger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif 242w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man vs Iron Monger\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/10135/313852-143896-obadiah-stane.gif 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man vs Iron Monger</figcaption></figure><p>After vowing to protect the child of a homeless woman who died while giving birth, Stark came to his senses. He once again recovered from alcoholism, built the Silver Centurion armor, and started a new company called Circuits Maximus. Once Stane discovered Tony's comeback, he attacked his rival but this time Stark fought back. He defeated the Chessmen and fought Stane whose Iron Monger was more powerful than his previous armor but not more powerful than the Centurion. Stane attacked Stark while holding his friends and family in death-traps. Among the prisoners were the child of the homeless woman who Tony vowed to protect, his friend and chauffeur <a href=\"../../happy-hogan/29-4262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Happy Hogan</a>, Happy's wife and Tony's executive assistant <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pepper Potts</a>, Tony's personal assistant <a href=\"../../mrs-bambi-arbogast/29-29314/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mrs. Bambi Arbogast</a>, and <a href=\"../../morley-erwin/29-31951/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morley Erwin</a> of his new company, Circuits Maximus. After killing Erwin, Stane demanded that Stark remove his helmet or he would kill the child next. Stark became aware that Stane could not control his power armor by himself and needed help from a nearby computer. Iron Man destroyed the nearby building holding Stane's external computer and saved the child from Stane. Obadiah Stane then removed his helmet and killed himself (eerily similar to the fate of his own father) when Stark told him it was all over. With Stane dead, Tony Stark was able to reacquire his family's company, reverting the name back to Stark International.</p><h4>The Future of the Iron Monger</h4><p>After Stane's demise, the original Iron Monger armor was obtained by the United States government. General Lewis Haywerth had one of the <a href=\"../../guardsmen/29-7578/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guardsmen</a> use it to test the combat readiness of the U.S. Agent. Another Iron Monger armor was built by industrialist Simon Steele. A third Iron Monger was subsequently built by Tony Stark's former college classmate, Joey Cosmatos, and worn by a criminal operative working for the underworld boss, Mr. Desmond. Recently, <a href=\"/ezekiel-stane/4005-54531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54531\">Ezekiel Stane</a> (son of the former business mogul) acquired Iron Man tech and some of his fathers business holdings. It is known that he intends to exact revenge upon Iron Man for the death of his father, but whether or not he will create or use another Iron Monger armor and identity remains to be seen.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Power Armor Suit</h3><p>The powers of Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger power armor are very similar to that of the Iron Man armor since Stane based his design on Stark's own. Obadiah himself had no super powers, but gained remarkable strength, invulnerability, and offensive weaponry while operating the Iron Monger suit. All of the suit's functions were similar yet stronger than Iron Man's original armor. The suit also had boot jets for flight, repulsion cannons, almost impenetrable body armor, and a chest-mounted laser cannon. Stane was not nearly as experienced in the manual use of his battle suit as Stark was, and was forced to use an external computer to control his armor's functions. When the computer was destroyed, Stane lost control of the Iron Monger.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Even without the Iron Monger, Stane was a formidable adversary. He had a genius-level intellect and unparalleled business acumen. He was also well known, and feared, for his ruthlessness.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Earth-1610: Ultimate Universe</h3><p>In this reality, Obadiah is younger and is the rival of Tony Stark. When <a href=\"../../howard-stark/29-48549/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Howard Stark</a> was taking his son's friends in a tour in the <a href=\"../../baxter-building/34-41454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baxter Building</a>, Obadiah killed two of Tony's friends and placed evidence that Howard killed them.

Jeff had read the comics as a kid and enjoyed the new modern approach to Iron Man in the film. His character starts out with a little history of his time before the movie where he was the second-in-command of Stark Industries during the time of Howard Stark. Eventually, at the passing of Howard he took over the company until Tony reached the age of twenty-one where Obadiah once again became the second man, but he lusted for the return of the power he had possessed.</p><p>Originally, he is believed to be a friend of Stark when Tony is missing for three months after he is captured in Afghanistan. Yet over time the true Stane is revealed when Tony returns and announces that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons after he learns that terrorists use them to kill the Americans that they were made to protect. When the board of directors begin to believe Anthony is suffering from post-traumatic stress and want to remove him from his position as CEO, Stane advises him to stay out of the public eye. The two get to talking and Tony suggests that Stark Industries begin working on harnessing the power within arc reactors instead of weapon manufacturing but Obadiah initially seems to be opposed to the idea. It is when Tony spontaneously decides to make a public appearance that he finds out Obadiah was the one making the \"under the table\" dealings with the terrorists. We then see Obadiah in Afghanistan discussing the giving of weapons with the military leader that had captured Tony earlier in the movie and tried to make him create a Jericho missile for the Ten Rings organization.</p><p>It is then that Obadiah is shown the prototype armor and plans Tony used to escape and is asked to make an army of them for Ten Rings to use in their domination of Asia. Yet, Obadiah proves who's really in charge when he uses a sonic device to temporarily paralyze the man. He steals the armor and plans, having all the Afghans killed as he walks away. But trouble arise back in America when his scientists reveal they cannot make an arc reactor to power the suit but that is only the first of Obadiah's problems. Tony has Pepper hack into the Stark Industries mainframe and download all its files for him. When she does this, however, she learns that Obadiah is creating a super armor based off the prototype and that he paid the Afghans to kill Tony (though they demanded higher payment when they realized who he was).</p><p>Unfortunately for Pepper, as she downloads the incriminating evidence Obadiah enters the office and begins talking about Tony with her. She manages to get the monitor on screen saver and finish downloading while they talk. Eventually she manages to take the flash drive with her as she speedily leaves the office, trying to escape the man. Obadiah then turns off the screen saver to see what it was she was doing, the moment it dawns on him he decides Pepper must die. Deciding he will get to Pepper later, Obadiah goes to Tony's mansion where he disables his former ally with the same device he had used on the terrorists' leader, a device Stark created. He reveals his involvement with Stark's abduction as well as his sinister intentions, including the murder of Pepper Potts. But before he leaves, he explains to Tony that the armor will be his legacy, just before he takes out Tony's arc reactor \"heart\" leaving his partner to die. Back at Stark Industries, in Sector 16, Obadiah places the arc reactor into the armor, activating its dormant power. Eventually Pepper and some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrive to arrest Obadiah and find the prototype armor, Pepper whispers that she thought it would be bigger.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6729997\" data-ratio=\"0.41770833333333\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6729997\"><img alt=\"Stane pilots the Iron Monger suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stane pilots the Iron Monger suit\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6729997-stane%20monger%20suit.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stane pilots the Iron Monger suit</figcaption></figure><p>As they search the place out, a giant armored man emerges from the shadows, Obadiah aka the Iron Monger. He chases after Pepper, intending to kill her, undaunted at the murder of all the government agents that are thrown aside with ease. Chasing her to the outside of the building, Obadiah says that he laments the fact that he has to kill her as he would have preferred her alive. He then raises his arm, a gun ejecting from it, ready to fire, until Iron Man comes to save the day. The two get into a long and strenuous fight, in which Tony fights with his weakened armor and Obadiah with an upgraded version of the prototype. It seems Tony has won when he brings Obadiah into the upper atmosphere and watches as the frozen leviathan plummets down to Malibu far below. Yet it is not over and despite civilian casualties they continue their confrontation on the roof of Stark Industries. Obadiah gains the upper hand and though Tony damages the armor it seems his victory is inevitable. That is until Pepper succeeds at performing Tony's request and releases the power of the giant arc reactor on display inside the building. The force destroys the building in a blast of energy and explosion, consuming Obadiah within it.</p><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086524\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.54976303317536\" data-width=\"422\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 422px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086524\"><img alt=\"Iron Man Armored Adventures\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg 422w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man Armored Adventures\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg 422w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/57906/1086524-obadiah_stane.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man Armored Adventures</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Obadiah Stane appears as a recurring villain in <em><a href=\"/iron-man-armored-adventures/4075-225/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-225\">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>, voiced by Mackenzie Gray.

He ran away as a teenager and bounced around the country, all the while getting military training from various sources until he decided to become a mercenary. He kept changing his identity whenever something went wrong with the mission. He moved to Canada where he met a man by the name of Wade T. Wilson. Since he was Wade W. Wilson, the name reminded him of his old self. When he was ordered to assassinate Wade T., he accidentally killed the target's wife, Mercedes. In the end, Wade T. ran away to eventually become the voodoo mercenary <a href=\"/t-ray/4005-19994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19994\">T-Ray</a> while Wade W. kept the name \"Wade T. Wilson\" and never changed it out of respect for his namesake's wife. When he was diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer, he volunteered for a subset of the Weapon-X program that was attempting to imbue a normal human with Wolverine’s healing factor.</p><p>Since he is Wade T. Wilson, he has Canadian citizenship, allowing him entry into the Weapon X program. The procedure was a success, but Deadpool, who took his name from the pool that the officers and scientists bet in as to who would die next in the experimentation, became severely mentally unbalanced as a result of it. He escaped the facility and has been wandering ever since. Some people might speculate that before his name was Wade Winston Wilson his name was Jack though this isn't confirmed.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4203666\" data-ratio=\"1.5523465703971\" data-width=\"554\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 554px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4203666\"><img alt=\"Deadpool's First Appearance.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg 554w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/84205/4203666-nm98nm96m101.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></a><figcaption>Deadpool's First Appearance.</figcaption></figure><p>Created by artist <a href=\"../../rob-liefeld/26-5181/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rob Liefeld</a> and writer <a href=\"../../fabian-nicieza/26-41350/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Nicieza</a>, Deadpool made his first appearance in <a href=\"../../the-new-mutants-the-beginning-of-the-end-part-one/37-33921/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The New Mutants #98</a> (1991).

He was a serious, grim and professional assassin, with none of his personality trademarks intact. It would be in his solo book that his trademark character traits would finally emerge. These would include the dark randomness to his actions, his humorous bend, schizophrenic tendencies, his suicidal personal outlook, and his 4th wall breaking quips that would make him famous, along with his love for Mexican food. Recently Deadpool has been trying to be a hero.</p><p>Deadpool has been known for carrying a number of weapons and sometimes it is as if they appear from nowhere, this is often referred to as a 'magic satchel'. Blind Al is also a significant catalyst in Deadpool's personal development, as there is a clear love hate relationship which can vary from Blind Al being a mother-like figure to an abused hostage; sometimes within the same storyline.</p><p>His personality has changed somewhat now he has become mortal; yet he still takes risks, welcoming the idea of dying so he may once again be united with his love, <a href=\"/death/4005-12620/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12620\">Death</a>. The same humor and incapability to take many battles seriously still remains, though his face no longer carries the scars from cancer or Weapon X.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Before Weapon X</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392030-tumblr_inline_ngci48iekj1rbdoc1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392030-tumblr_inline_ngci48iekj1rbdoc1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Wade's father being killed by one of Wade's friends.

Wade was filled with grief.</figcaption></figure><p>Wade Wilson is a man shrouded in mystery. For instance: Wade Wilson may not be his real name and his back story may have been stolen (in-continuity) from another character. He remembers a mother who died of cancer when he was five, another mother who beat him during his teen years. He remembers a father who abandoned him in his childhood-years and yet another father who died in a bar room altercation when he was 17. That father was a good man but a militarie man whom was very strickt with Wade, to whom Wade rebbeled. He was shot by one of Wade's friends, which caused Wade to be filled with remorse. The final father is the only one who is definitely real, all the other snatches and fragments of memories may be the result of his broken psyche. It is later revealed that the various conflicting memories of his family were implanted by a man named Butler, and that Deadpool had actually been forced to kill his own family while under Butler's control.</p><p>He remembers an upbringing in <a href=\"../../ohio/34-55742/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohio</a>, but even he recognizes that this may not be true. This mysterious young man joined and quickly excelled in military service, or at least the combat side of service. The strict hierarchy and rules didn’t jibe with the young man’s sense of self and his absolute need to rebel against authority figures, clearly military life was not for him and he was dishonorably discharged. The military did teach him two things: he was good at killing and he enjoyed it, so he quickly found work as a mercenary, though at first he only took on targets who he felt deserved to die.</p><p>Eventually he wound up in Japan as a Yakuza enforcer where he fell in love with one of the boss’ daughters. The young man’s mind was already in a state of radical instability, though, and he knew the relationship could never be, so he returned to America and ditched his previous moral code in addition to changing his entire identity, even his appearance, after each failed mission, fracturing his mind even more severely.</p><p>When an ordinary couple stumbled upon the wounded mercenary in the woods, they took him into their home. The woman even nurses him back to health but again his unstable mind strikes, and he becomes enamored with the young woman and envious of her life with her husband. So he burns their house down and kills her husband before accidentally killing her too. He takes the name Wade Wilson and believes himself to be the dead woman’s husband, but still returns to the mercenary trade. It was later found out in the Cable/Deadpool series, that this story was a lie and that Deadpool is the real Wade Wilson.</p><p>It’s at this stage in his life that he meets the shape-shifting prostitute <a href=\"../../copycat/29-13311/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vanessa Carlysle</a>. The young couple quickly fall in love, both of them tainted by pasts they’d rather forget. Wilson’s possibly idyllic life is shattered, however, when he contracts cancer and leaves Vanessa because he doesn’t want to burden her with his failing health.</p><h3>The Weapon X Program</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5392028\" data-ratio=\"1.087044534413\" data-width=\"494\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 494px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5392028\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" data-width=\"588\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg 494w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5392028-deadpool_vol_1_57.jpg 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" data-width=\"588\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Wilson joins Canada’s <a href=\"/department-h-headquarters-toronto/4020-56033/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56033\">Department H</a>, seeking a cure for his cancer, which they promised but never delivered on.

Since his cells are in constant flux, his brain is unstable, contributing to his madness. As a costumed mercenary, Deadpool frequents the horrific <a href=\"../../the-hell-house/34-56238/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hell House</a>, where he receives assignments. Eventually <a href=\"../../tolliver/29-15530/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tolliver</a>, the man who runs the hangout, sends Deadpool to kill Cable. The mercenary fails when his attack is thwarted by Domino (who is actually his old girlfriend Copycat [Vanessa Carlyle] posing as <a href=\"/domino/4005-2161/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2161\">Domino</a> with a counter mission to blow up Cable's whole <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> team; a mission sanctioned by Tolliver himself). Cable and X-Force, including the fake Domino, mail Deadpool back to Tolliver.</p><p>Deadpool becomes Tolliver's lap dog. Deadpool runs various operations on behalf of his employer, like overseeing the shipping of dangerous goods. Garrison Kane, on behalf of the Canadian government, breaks up this operation but lets Deadpool teleport away when he gets distracted by the appearance of <a href=\"/gw-bridge/4005-15062/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15062\">G.W. Bridge</a>. He next is sent to the World Trade Center to abduct <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/4005-4568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4568\">Black Tom Cassidy</a> who had just been thoroughly shot by Cable. Deadpool also gets Black Tom's partner the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> to accompany them to Tolliver's. There, Black Tom is operated on and infused with plant life. Black Tom would later leave Tolliver's house.</p><p>Deadpool's next mission from Tolliver is more personal - he's to track down Vanessa, impersonating Domino within the ranks of X-Force, and find out why she hasn't completed her mission. He infiltrates the X-Force base in the Adirondack Mountains and engages her in a royal tussle. He defeats her and convinces her to finish her job for Tolliver and then to rejoin the team. Vanessa is found by Cable and she continues to lie by stating that she is Domino but was hired by Tolliver to kill him. Cable then takes the fight to Tolliver. Deadpool protects his boss by stabbing Vanessa and then going one-on-one with Cable. Deadpool loses and passes out. Once Cable leaves to kill Tolliver (after finding and freeing the real Domino) in a helicopter explosion, Deadpool awakens to find that Vanessa has slinked off.

Outside his safe-house awaits a bunch of mercenaries. Deadpool gets the drop on them and takes them out easily. Inside, Weasel informs Deadpool that he is a wanted man. Since Tolliver's death, a rumor has circulated about a will that leaves all of Tolliver's assets to the last man standing from his former empire. Being such a prominent member of Tolliver's operations, Deadpool is a marked man. Deadpool is less interested in the will and mainly wants to find Copycat. Before he gets any answers, however, Garrison Kane shows up and starts a fight. He is also looking for Copycat and won't back down until he finds her. It's a few minutes into a very intense fight before Weasel pipes in and reminds the both of them that neither of them actually knows where Copycat is at that time. As a piece of goodwill, Kane informs Deadpool that an old friend is back and looking to kill Deadpool: <a href=\"/slayback/4005-26752/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26752\">Slayback</a>.</p><p>With a growing interest in Tolliver's will, Deadpool looks up a man named <a href=\"/mr-gezdbadah/4005-84491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84491\">Mr. Gezdbadah</a>, an informant with a very special briefcase. He finds Gezdbadah fleeing from some mercenaries that Deadpool takes out easily. Gezdbadah is more than happy to pass along the briefcase, which contains a disc with information about the Tolliver will. The case is immediately taken by the Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy before Deadpool can inspect the disc. Deadpool and Weasel track the two men to a commercial plane and Deadpool boards it and confronts the men. Black Tom blasts Deadpool. Deadpool responds by blowing up the plane's hatch, sucking Black Tom out of the plane. Deadpool catches him with a rope and blackmails Juggernaut in giving up the briefcase. Juggernaut does so easily and Deadpool lets Black Tom go. The Juggernaut jumps out of the plane after him. Deadpool then announces that the plane has been officially hijacked.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-693171\" data-ratio=\"0.73875\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-693171\"><img alt=\"Wade's one-sided love affair with one-time flame, Siryn.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg 800w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wade's one-sided love affair with one-time flame, Siryn.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg 800w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/35113/693171-siryndeadpool.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wade's one-sided love affair with one-time flame, Siryn.</figcaption></figure><p>His life was forever changed when he teamed with erstwhile X-member <a href=\"/siryn/4005-3181/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3181\">Siryn</a> to hunt down <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/4005-4568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4568\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>.

Cable and Deadpool fight but due to a teleportation error, the two are linked and one cannot teleport without teleporting the other thus it's like the expression \"You scratch my back and I scratch yours\". Although they start out as enemies and find it amazingly difficult to be in each others presence, the two manage to become somewhat of uneasy allies after some time. Deadpool is there when Cable constructs his own island nation. Deadpool, after some time, accepts Cable's offer to join him on his island and the two become real friends, although neither of them would ever admit it. Deadpool even tells Cable about his origin, how he was the son of a military dad, and how Wade got in with the wrong kind of friends.</p><p>One of them, eventually killed his dad when he tried to take Wade out of a bar. Deadpool gets inspired by Cable's way of life and tries to become a better person, stopping his former violent ways. This works out to some extend, but Cable and Deadpool clashed numerous times after that. One of their largest fights was when Wade sided with the pro-registration act group of superheroes during the Superhuman Civil War. Cable eventually took reign over the small European country known as Rumekistan. Deadpool was hired by the government of that country to stop this from happening and even shot Cable in the back.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4831227\" data-ratio=\"1.5898203592814\" data-width=\"668\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 668px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:159.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4831227\"><img alt=\"Deadpool's X-Men colors\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 668w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 603w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool's X-Men colors\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 668w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 603w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4831227-7568094250-13150.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool's X-Men colors</figcaption></figure><p>Cable however managed to stop the bullet and defeated Deadpool and his teammates of other mercenaries.

Cable's city was destroyed and Deadpool feared the worst for his good friend.</p><p>Cable however later resurfaced when he tried to safe-keep the first baby mutant that was born since M-Day. Deadpool found out about Cable's mission and aided him in keeping the baby safe. They where attacked by various advisories such as the Marauders, the Purifiers and even some creatures named Predator X. After this, Cable made Deadpool promise to stop following him, and he told him that they would see each-other again. This however turned out not to be true. Cable was killed during the events of Second Coming. Deadpool was devastated. His former greatest enemy and now best friend was no more. He went back to Rumekistan (at least the thought it was Rumekistan) and tried to honor Cable by making the country a better nation.</p><h3><a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\">Secret Invasion</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-430427\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco Medina16.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5185714285714\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco Medina16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-430427\"><img alt=\"Deadpool takes on the Skrulls\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool takes on the Skrulls\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/430427-Deadpool_Paco%20Medina16.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool takes on the Skrulls</figcaption></figure><p>While the skrulls were invading a baseball stadium, Deadpool (disguised as a mascot) came and destroyed a Skrull gunship to get their attention.

Deadpool then has the team go after the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>.

Bob did so to teach Deadpool a lesson only to realize that Deadpool wanted to die the whole time and wanted X-Force to kill him after he gets the serum. Bob then gets angry at Wade and tells him that if he gets killed by X-Force, Tombstone will kill Bob for not allowing Tombstone to kill Deadpool himself. So Deadpool decides to save Bob from Tombstone before he kicks the bucket.</p><p>In this process, Deadpool finally gets what he wanted and is injected with the serum that can finally make him kill-able. But to his surprise, not only did his healing factor disappear, but his scarred skin also vanished. He is now back to his formal, more handsome, self. Now more confident because of this transformation, he thought he would attack the base of the smartest super villain team on earth, the Intelligencia. But when he's outsmarted and defeated by the Trapster (who shoots glue at people) Deadpool thinks he lost his old mercenary mojo. So in order to get his revenge and his fundamentals back in check, he goes to the aid of Taskmaster.</p><h3><a href=\"/marvel-now/4015-56129/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56129\">D</a>ead Presidents (Marvel NOW)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3052183\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3374149659864\" data-width=\"735\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 735px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3052183\"><img alt=\"Deadpool vs. the undead Presidents\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 735w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 478w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool vs. the undead Presidents\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 735w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3052183-deadpool__6_variant_cover_by_adamwarren-d5yoijn.jpg 478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool vs. the undead Presidents</figcaption></figure><p>A madman, believing the United States is tearing itself apart, has resurrected the dead presidents of the country in hopes of them restoring the country to its former glory. The plan goes awry when the zombified forefathers become evil and start attacking people. Deadpool is seen cutting his way out of a large reptilian-like creature, disemboweling it in the process, which sets him and <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> free. When Thor flies away, Deadpool is told that the evil Franklin Delano Roosevelt is attacking the city. Deadpool heads to the location and begins a battle with the necrotic, evil president. The battle makes its way to a subway, where Deadpool manages to beat FDR via electrocution. <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> tasks Deadpool with stopping the assaulting presidents which he accepts, charging off to their meeting place to stop them. When he arrives, he is shot in the head by Lincoln, dropping him.</p><p>The ghost of Ben Franklin resuscitates Deadpool and he eventually goes after the zombified Theodore Roosevelt, who is killing animals at the zoo. Deadpool defeats him with the help of an elephant, after finding out that the dead presidents have a weakness to electricity by having said elephant ram Roosevelt into a generator. Deadpool visits <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> to get his help in the matter of the dead presidents, and they learn where Gerald Ford, George Washington and Abe Lincoln are. Strange and Wade teleport there and attack the presidents. Deadpool is incapacitated by getting stuck in a car and punted away, and Washington stabs him with a sword. Strange takes the old saber from Deadpool and enchants it to defeat the presidents. Deadpool dubs the sword the Veto before stabbing Nixon, defeating him while the others escape.</p><p>Deadpool does battle with all the other presidents, slaying the significant zombie powerhouses like Lincoln, and Regan. Deadpool ends up in a heated battle with George Washington after Washington killed <a href=\"/emily-preston/4005-86531/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86531\">Agent Preston</a>, whom Wade dubbed as his friend. After slaying the final president, things settled down with the necromancer reviving Preston, but putting her inside Wade's mind.</p><h3>Soul Hunter</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3032217\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.6703125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3032217\"><img alt=\"Deadpool kills Michael\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool kills Michael\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3032217-deadpool%20michael%201.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool kills Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Deadpool is recruited by a demon named <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/vetis/4005-88345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88345\">Vetis</a> after Deadpool tricked him in a previous deal. He is on a mission from Vetis to kill six individuals in order for Vetis to reclaim his power, but also on the side is trying to find a body for Preston to get her out of his head. After killing some of the individuals on the list, Deadpool learns Vetis is trying to overthrow Mephisto. In order to summon Mephisto Deadpool kills his friend, Michael the necromancer, who just happened to be on the list, in order to get him to hell to tell Mephisto about Vetis' plan. Deadpool targets a pre-cog user and teams up with the superior Spider-Man to face the Trapster, Batroc, Chance, Taskmaster, and Lady Stilt-Man. The duo end up defeating the group and Deadpool kills Gump the pre-cog, but Deadpool is subdued by Spider-Man for killing him, only for Deadpool to break out when Spider-Man leaves.</p><p>With Michael in hell now, Deadpool manages to explain the situation to Preston's family and her partner at S.H.I.E.L.D.. Deadpool hunts down the next holder of power by the name of Bobby the Blender, who happens to be a shapeshifter. He takes the form of Luke Cage and tries to have sex with Jessica, but Deadpool intervenes when he is discovered by Jessica and attacks him. Bobby turns into Black Widow and jumps out the window with Deadpool in hot pursuit. Along the way, Deadpool gets beaten up by cops and Bobby turns into a cheerleader when Deadpool beats up the cops and yells for everyone in Times Square to get down to find him. Deadpool encounters more resistance, but most notably from Daredevil. The two have a brief fight with Wade getting tied up and escaping by breaking his fingers to get his gun and shoot a nearby pedestrian. Daredevil then takes time to attend to this person while Wade finds Bobby and kills him. Vetis arrives and Deadpool tells him his plan which angers Vetis as he prepares to attack Wade.</p><p>Deadpool manages to hold out against Vetis long enough for <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> and the newly resurrected Michael to appear. Michael and Deadpool manage to defeat the demon and Mephisto eats his heart. They travel to Deadpool's mind where Mephisto tries to coerse Preston and Deadpool to make a deal with him. Deadpool refuses and the group travels to the closed off part of Wade's mind where they discuss how they will find a new body for Preston and help Deadpool with his memories.</p><h3>The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3047910\" data-ratio=\"1.5233333333333\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3047910\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 420w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/3047910-dpool2012015.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Deadpool has recently found out that his organs have been harvested for around seven years from a man named The Butler.

Both saying no, Wade returns to his home only to find Logan there, saying he was also followed. The Merc with the Mouth and Wolverine hold their own but are overwhelmed. Wade wakes up at the Butler's HQ, and escapes with Butler to question him. However, he gets shot in the head and re-captured.

He is granted membership in the <a href=\"/avengers-unity-squad/4060-59251/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59251\">Avengers Unity Squad</a> by Steve Rogers, and uses funds from merchandise sales to help fund the team. He also bankrolls a new <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/4060-23588/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23588\">Heroes For Hire</a> roster (later renamed \"Mercs For Money\"). As this is going on, Ellie is living with Agent Preston and her family.</p><p>Also round this time, Deadpool's marriage to Shiklah hasn't been going well. Due to all of his newfound fame, and responsibility, he's gotten too busy for her. Due to his devotion to mankind, at the expense of being her husband and consort, Shiklah becomes increasingly bitter towards the humans, whom she feels her husband cares too much about. Due to Wade's neglect, Shiklah begins taking other lovers to satisfy her where Wade no longer is. Her most valued lover being Jack Russell, the werewolf by night, who notes that Deadpool would kill him if he knew about it. But Shiklah is confident that Wade won't find out.</p><h3>Madcap</h3><p>During his adventures with the Unity Squad, and family problems, Wade also had to deal with Madcap, who is determined at any cost to ruin his life. Years back, he was merged with Madcap due to a freak accident by Thor. Madcap being the white voice-box inside of his head. They have fought many times, but sadly, the fights never lead anywhere, since both are basically unkillable. Madcap decides if he can't do anything to Wade, he could hurt Wade by going after his loved ones. He becomes one of Wade's most formidable and dangerous enemies.</p><h3>Civil War II</h3><p>Due to Wade's new lifestyle, he's gotten a bit more reckless with his mercs, and Preston isn't happy about it. After many difficulties, Wade disbands from his mercs and they burn their contracts. He later drops by to visit Preston, who makes clear he's not welcome due to how out of control he's been acting as of late. He also discovers Ellie calling him by his first name, which throws him off. She reveals that her therapist told her that she shouldn't consider him a father-figure. Preston punches him, using her robot strength, and slams the door in his face. Ellie looks out of the window and tells him bye. Wade just thinks to himself that he deserves whatever he gets.</p><p>After the failure of his mercs, and being kicked out by Preston, he returns home to Shiklah -complaining about his luck. It's at this time he finally discovers Shiklah's infidelity. He finds Jack in bed with Shiklah, and blows his head off with a shotgun, despite Jack trying to explain himself. Shiklah tells him that they talked about it before, and he knows they're both allowed a certain number of \"invitations\". Wade tells her she's expanding her guest list. As Shiklah denies this claim, a female monster emerges from under the duvet, and runs away in fear of Deadpool. He asks her to explain the other monster, and she then confesses that there have been many visitors to her chambers. She lists off the other lovers she's had, and Wade interrupts her angrily saying that he gets the point. Shiklah tells him he knew who he was marrying.</p><p>The two end up in a fight, which leads from Shiklah's chambers all the way to the streets of Manhattan while they continue to argue about their marriage. Shiklah goes from being angry to excited, telling Wade she's missed him. He says it's good he can still make her horny, before receiving a kick to the stomach. As he lies on the ground, Shiklah tells him that the humans he loves will all die. Wade asks her what she said. He angrily delivers a kick to her face, once again asking her to repeat what she just said. Shiklah asks Wade if he thought she was threatening his loved ones. She says maybe she was. Wade asks if they can just be done with their fighting now. He offers to get a dog, and let Shiklah shoot it in his bed.</p><p>Shiklah calms down, and relents on the fighting, She puts a foot on Wade's throat, and tells him that was the most fun they'd had in a while. She invites him back to bed, but he declines going back to the bed he just shot the werewolf in. Shiklah tells him Jack will be fine. His head will regenerate, but he'll have a puppy face for a while. She once again invites him to come back down, stating it could be romantic. Wade still passes on the offer. She laughs and tells him it's fine. She takes her leave, but not before saying it's never the end for them. This confuses Deadpool, who's surprised that Shiklah doesn't want their relationship over.</p><p>He wonders around Manhattan dejected before moving some of his weapons into the old Avengers hideout, which is in ruins. It's there he meets Rogue, he tells her about his marital problems with Shiklah, before asking her for a favor. He takes her to see Ellie, and asks if she'll look out for her if she gets mutant powers one day. Rogue says she'll have Ellie's back.</p><h3>Stryfe</h3><p>Madcap makes his move on Deadpool by exposing him to a deadly virus, which Wade unknowingly passed to Preston's family, and his daughter. The virus will do nothing to Wade, given his healing factor, but Madcap planned on using Wade to spread it to his loved ones as a way of finally breaking him. Wade has to find a cure to save everyone, and none of his friends are available to help him, so he turns to Stryfe.</p><p>Stryfe gives him the cure to save everyone, but states it will cost him. He will save four lives for Wade. In exchange, Wade will have to claim four lives for him. Wade asks Stryfe who he wants dead, but Stryfe doesn't wish to reveal that info just yet. He simply tells Wade to think of it as a long-term payment plan. Wade doesn't want to owe Stryfe anything and gives him the cure back until Styfe tells him that everyone will die, Preston's husband being the first to go. Stryfe asks if Wade will let his family suffer because of him. Wade accept the cure, and Stryfe's deal to save his family.</p><p>Wade returns with the cure, and manages to have Ellie, and Preston's family. Preston sits with Wade and the kids, asking if they're ready to go home. Wade tells Ellie to fist-bump him, prompting Ellie to ask if she's gonna be poisoned again. Wade says there's only one way to find out. Preston tells Wade to kiss Cable for her, to thank him for the cure. Wade pauses, and tells her sure, before being shown moping due to now being indebted to Stryfe, unbeknownst to anyone else.</p><h3>Til Death Do Us</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5945013\" data-ratio=\"0.83702213279678\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5945013\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 1988w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 1988w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5945013-rco001_1488384954.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>This arc marks the final crumbling of Deadpool and Shiklah's relationship.</p><p>An ancient monster, named Farcus ends up getting loose in the subway. He wonders around confused and smashing everything in sight before being gunned down by citizens. Shiklah was alerted of his wondering off by a guard, and they hurry to find him, with Shiklah noting his mind is too feeble for him to be wondering on his own. Sadly, she makes it in time to find his dead body, and the humans who killed him. Enraged, she transforms into her true demon form, set on murdering the ones who killed Fracus.</p><p>Deadpool arrives and tells her to calm down. Shiklah reverts, and tells him what happened. She screams that Fracus have lived in the lands since before the Vikings discovered it, but his body outlasted his mind. She's even more upset that she hears his last words were about returning home.</p><p>Deadpool tries to calm her down by explaining that these things happen in the subway, admitting to having killed a man just for playing bagpipes. Shiklah gets angrier at Deadpool for defending the \"disgusting\" humans, and he argues he's not defending them. He says they overreacted, but the humans have a justice system to deal with these types of matters. It's really brutal handlings, and she'd enjoy it. He suggests she take the humans to court, which she agrees to do -wanting to see what human justice looks like.</p><p>The judges rules in favor of the humans, which Shiklah is furious about. She leaves, stating she will make her own justice, and it won't be kind. Back in the Monster Metropolis, everyone is furious. Deadpool wonders if Shiklah can calm them down, and she says she could if she wanted to -but she doesn't. She then makes it known she plans to rise up with her monsters and annex Manhattan, feeling her kind has cowered underground long enough. Deadpool tries to apologize to her for not being around much, but Shiklah doesn't care to hear it. She assures him it's too late for all that, and that things are more serious.</p><p>She asks Wade to follow her downstairs, stating she needs him for something. He'll do anything if it will prevent a war. She kisses him, then opens a door to reveal personal soldiers of her's. She wants Wade to stay out of the way while she deals with concurring Manhattan, thus she orders her servants to chop him into pieces and keep him in buckets.</p><p>Wade isn't happy about this, and begins to fight off her servants. He asks them to stand down, since he doesn't have a personal problem with them, but he pauses and asks if they're sleeping with Shiklah too, which turns out to be true. Deadpool gets angry and chops the heads off of one of the guards. He sarcastically tells him to ask Shiklah to kiss it better before making his escape into the subway.</p><p>Deadpool tries to call in all the comrades he can to help stop Shiklah -leading to an all-out war. Spider-Man shows up to help Deadpool, and long with his Mercs for Money team. As a last resort, Deadpool and Spider-Man go to recruit Dracula to help stop Shiklah. They return with him, and he uses his powers to take control of the vampires in Shiklah's army. Shiklah's subjects warn her of what's happening, and she goes to the front lines to do battle. She meets up with Dracula again, and reverts to her humanoid form. He says they should end the fighting, and she asks what he suggests.</p><p>He states that his desire to marry her is still present after all that time, and proposes. Deadpool is shocked and angry upon hearing this. Shiklah seems shocked, but Dracula goes on to say they can rule together with the humans at their feet. Deadpool is angry, and everyone is worried, but Spider-Man tells them Shiklah could still say no. Shiklah accepts his proposal, and Spider-Man tells them nevermind. Dracula and Shiklah quickly wed, with Wade and Spider-Man held prisoners as witnesses. Mephisto, as the pastor for the two, says that Shiklah and Dracula is a couple he can support, though he admits he's better at erasing marriages.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5939902\" data-ratio=\"0.8430583501006\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5939902\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 1988w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 1988w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11131/111317321/5939902-new%20husband.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The new couple kiss, and Shiklah says they need to do something since their subjects are at one another's throats. Dracula and Shiklah take there leave, with the latter saying the giant spider can eat Wade and his friend. Spider-Man manages to get free and deal with the spider demon, before freeing Wade as well. Wade tells him to handle Dracula, and he knows how to stop Shiklah.</p><p>He meets up with her again, after her monsters have rejected her as a monarch. He protests her marriage to Dracula, reminding her that he killed her brothers. Shiklah tells Deadpool he would have done the same thing if he'd known her brothers. Wade admits that he screwed up, but tells her not to double-down on his screw-up by marrying Dracula. Shiklah tackles him into a pile of rubble, screaming that he not tell her who she can impetuously marry.</p><p>We don't see them until Spider-Man is knocked into that same pile of rubble, where it's discovered Wade and Shiklah were having sex again. Spider-Man asks if there's no shame, and Wade wonders which one of them he's referring to. Shiklah invites him to watch and learn something, but he leaves in disgust. Afterwards, they get dressed and Shiklah talks to Wade, asking him why he burdens himself with humans that he will outlive. Wade says they aren't always a burden, but admits killing them is easier than living with them. He tells her that you don't plan to love someone, it just happens one day at a time, until you wake up and can't think of a good reason to kill them. You just have to keep going and see what you find. He asks if that made sense to her, or just him. She smiles gives him a draining kiss, mirroring how they first met. She smiles to his unconscious body, and tells him goodbye. Shiklah gives up her rule, and allows her monsters to care for themselves. She departs for her honeymoon with Dracula.</p><p>The war ended, Wade finally wakes up again to ask Spider-Man what he's missed. Spider-Man tells Deadpool he's single now. At this time, he's approached by numerous lawyers to give him lawsuits for all the property damage his wife caused. One of the monsters gives him a letter from Shiklah. Wade is happy, thinking that she really did care about him. He opens it, and Shiklah tells him she's not writing to him because she cares. She says he's free to get on with his sorry life and that he doesn't have to mope. She goes on to confess that she rushed into their marriage, and being a monarch -both things she shouldn't have been reckless about.</p><p>Her plans are to see more of the new world, since she'd slept away so many centuries. She will be on her honeymoon, engaging in \"stake play\" with Dracula, but tells Wade to keep his phone on, because he'd never know when booty calls. She closes by telling him to be good to himself. Wade tosses the letter away and admits it's nice for a relationship to end without a corpse, then says it's interesting finding new ways to screw up. He later confesses that he believes he and Shiklah are still technically married.</p><p>Deadpool 2099 reveals that Deadpool and Shiklah go to war with one another again, and have a daughter sometime in the future.</p><h3>Secret Empire</h3><p>After the ruin of his relationship, Deadpool ends up going on a space journey in hopes of finding something that can defeat Madcap. But he has no such luck. He returns to Earth, and drops off souvenirs for Ellie and Terry jr. He runs into Cap, who says he needs Wade's help. Wade tells Cap that there's nothing he wouldn't do for him.</p><p>Wade was still working with the Avengers in defeating Red-Skull. Rogue absorbs Deadpool's powers, which weakens her enough for Wonder Man to finally be freed. Later, Wade confesses that he'd stolen Wonder Man's money from the bank to help in funding the Avenger's team.</p><p>He tries to sell the old theater they used for a hideout to get Simon's money back, but he's told the building is too much of a financial risk. Wonder Man takes his leave, complaining about Cap making Wade an Avenger. Wade thinks he should steal from more pacifists, shortly before Cap pulls up. He tells Wade to get in, and that it's time to serve his country.</p><p>We later see Cap briefing Wade for an important mission. He has tasked Wade the job of finding and killing S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Phil Coulson, who has become a big threat. Wade drops by the Preston house during a family barbecue to get information. He asks Preston where Coulson's safe-house is, since he's dropped off the radar. Preston says she's not telling him anything, because it wouldn't be a safe house if <strong>he</strong> knew about it. However, Wade makes a deal that's too good to refuse. He promises that if she tells, he won't bother her or the family for the entire summer.</p><p>Deadpool travels to the safe-house, but spots Coulson on the way there and shoots his flying car out of the sky. Coulson calls out that the unknown attacker will pay for destroying Lola. Wade makes himself known and says he should kill Coulson on principle for giving that name to his car. Seeing who the attacker is, Coulson realizes he won't win a fight and tells Wade to back off, while planting explosives into a tree before fleeing. Deadpool sees this and investigates before he's blown back by the explosion.</p><p>Coulson is happy with the time he bought and knows everything will be fine if he can just make it to his safe-house. He wonders how Deadpool knew about the place and concludes Preston must have told him., thinking to himself that he won't forgive her. He knows it was most-likely Cap who sent Deadpool after him. He'd die for Captain America, but sadly knows that Deadpool will kill for him.</p><p>Deadpool shows up, shooting at Coulson, who screams for him to wait. He manages to unlock the panic room and orders the door to seal, but Wade sticks his arm through, preventing the door from closing. Coulson again tries to talk to him, telling Wade that he's on the wrong side, but Wade asks him when has Captain America ever been wrong.</p><p>Wade manages to get his gun through the cracked door, and Coulson sadly resigns himself to his fate. He regrets it came to this, because he had a chance to stop everything. Wade shoots him in the chest, with Coulson weakly telling him to stop, before falling to the ground, lifeless.</p><p>Cap shows up, and asks if Deadpool completed his mission. Deadpool confirms success, before blowing up Coulson's hide-out. ,He asks Cap if he gets to know why he had to kill Coulson and Cap says he will know everything soon enough, but not right now. Wade seems to feel badly, but Cap assures him that Coulson was a needed sacrifice. Wade asks how he's going to explain things to Preston and Cap assures him that she'll understand -everyone will. He says Wade has helped America, before taking his leave. Wade still doesn't feel any better, as he watches the building go up in flames.</p><p>A time-skip shows that Deadpool is now living in a luxury apartment in Washington D.C, where he's a member of the Hydra Avengers. By this time, he's discovered Cap is with Hydra and that it was a mistake to kill Coulson, whom he's having nightmares about. He gets dressed and heads into the living-room, preparing to take Ellie to school, who's now living with him.</p><p>He takes her to school on his motorcycle, and she tells him she doesn't like it. He says he can tell by the number of kids she's beaten up. He wants her to give the school a chance, since it took a lot for him to get her accepted. He drops her off, telling her to let a teacher know if other kids try to bully her.</p><p>Wade rides away, insisting that he's perfectly content with the new Hydra government, saying some of his best friends are with Hydra. He goes to HQ, and has been tasked with the job of hunting down heroes of the resistance. He arrives to speak with Cap, but is told his handling other important business. He leaves a message, that he's going hunting, and afterwards, he'd like an audience. He starts to take his leave when one of the agents asks him if he's forgetting something. Deadpool then says \"Fail Hydra.\" This angers the agent, who asks him what he said. Wade then apologizes, then replies \"Gale Hydra\" and \"Nail Hydra.\"</p><p>Later, he is shown finding and battling against Speedall. After having many of his attacks reflected by on him, he finally smoke bombs Speedball, and chokes him unconscious. He then calls for Hydra to come take him away. They note Speedball isn't a very big part of the resistance, and Wade says he's working up to it. He takes his leave, but not before shouting \"Kale Hydra.\"</p><p>He continues on his mission to find resistance leaders. He checks Thunderbolt Mountain, Xavier Mansion, and Stark's old hideouts. But they're all empty. As he checks the Mount, he feels a gust of wind pass by, noting that it was Quicksilver. Deadpool scopes in, and sees Pietro delivering things for Clint. He found one of the resistances bases, thinking it may be the main base, and may have numerous heroes crammed inside. Wade figures taking them out would cost lives on both sides.</p><p>He makes it back to Washington to take Ellie to school, who still doesn't like it. He drops her off, and notes how much she hates her school, but shrugs it off by saying he also hates his job. He returns to HQ and starts to report on The Mount, but receives a text, and tells the Hydra agents to wait. The message is from Ellie's school, telling him to come down because she's been in another fight. The Agent impatiently asks what Deadpool was going to say about The Mount. Deadpool tells him to cross it off the board because it's empty. He has to leave and go to Ellie's school, but not before the agent stops him. He asks Wade if he's forgetting something, and Wade finally does a proper \"Hail Hydra,\"</p><p>Deadpool sits in the principal's office with Ellie, clearly unhappy -wondering why the principal singles out Ellie if other kids are bullying her. The principal says the other kids said Ellie attacked them, which Ellie confesses to, but notes they deserved it. Wade is cavalier about the situation, which angers the principal, who says that Ellie is expelled. Wade knocks out the principal and says the conversation is boring.</p><p>As they both leave the school Ellie says she wants her mom. Deadpool tells her that he already mentioned how Preston had to go underground. She begins to cry, asking Wade if he's lying to her, but he doesn't respond. She asks him again what happened to her mother, and we see a flashback of the events. A dark dome had appeared over Manhattan as Preston prepares to take Ellie to school. She called her husband to pick up their son, and tells Ellie to go back inside because she's not going to school. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised, but Preston's synthetic body is immune. Wade meets up with her, wanting to check on them when the dome appeared.</p><p>Preston says she's happy to see him, and asks him to get in the car. Wade wonders what their plans is, and Preston reveals that it's to find Coulson because he knew something was up -which is why he had to go into hiding. Wade is silent upon hearing this. After 50 miles, Preston wonders what's wrong, because something has to be up for him to be so quiet. Wade insists that they should be back in Manhattan where everything is happening, not heading away from it. Preston asks him why he needed to see Coulson the other day, and what was so important.</p><p>Wade says Cap had worries about Coulson going dark on them, then lies and says he never found him. They make it to Coulson's burned-down safe-house, and Preston is horrified and confused. Wade lies again, and says it wasn't like this when he was here and says Coulson may have done it to cover his tracks. Preston agrees with the possibility, and tells Deadpool to check inside. She goes to check a nearby surveillance camera, which reveals what really happened to Coulson the other night.</p><p>Preston is distraught and cries, but plays it off when Wade comes back. He says he didn't see any signs of Coulson, but that they shouldn't jump to conclusions. Preston agrees, and Wade asks her what's next. She says she wants to tell him something about Ellie that he may not know. Wade asks her what that is, and she punches him. She screams that Ellie called the good man he murdered, \"uncle Phil.\"</p><p>Back in the present, Wade tells Ellie that there are some things a kid shouldn't have to deal with. He explains to her about the different burdens that people carry, and how they don't get to chose what their burden is. She says she doesn't understand and just wants to go home to the Preston's. Wade says she can't ever go back and Ellie cries, wondering why. Wade explains to her that the world is suddenly a different place, and she's also different.</p><p>Ellie doesn't know what he means by that. He finally explains to her that she's a mutant, and the new world is moving against people like her in order to make others feel safe. He says life is hard on everyone, but it's dangerous for a young mutant like herself, especially when her powers haven't awakened. He continues to explain that he has to go extra miles to keep her safe, so when he tells her to do something -like behave at a new school, she needs to listen to him. He tells her he has to leave for work to lock the door, and don't open it for anyone.</p><p>Later he reports into Hydra HQ bringing in someone. He says it's Triathlon. The agent has never heard of him, and wonders how this is better than bringing in Hawkeye, who's the leader of the resistance. Wade insists that he's a power hero, but he could always let him go. The agent tells him no. he asks if Thriathlon knows where Hawkeye and his people are, and Wade just assures him he's working on it. The agent tells him that the supreme leader expects results from him. Wade says he will bring in Hawkeye and may be off the grid for a few days, before taking his leave.</p><p>Later at Hydra's HQ, Wade reports in with that he captured Paste Pot Pete. The agents are shocked that Wade is naked, covered with paste with only his mask covering his neither region. The head agent says to take Pete away. He later asks that Deadpool bring in Maria Hill, hoping he won't be conflicted about turning in an old friend from S.H.I.E.LD. Wade says he won't, before we see what happened with him and Preston.</p><p>She savagely beats him for murdering Coulson, and demanding answers. Wade explains he was working for Rogers, who told him that Coulson had gone rogue and needed stopping by any means necessary. Preston continues her violent assault on Wade -knocking out 3 of his teeth, fracturing his ribs &amp; sternum, with some of the bone going into his lungs. She calls him weak-minded and notes because of how easily manipulated he is, she spent time thinking of a way to kill him over the years. She throws him into a tree, saying nothing is scarier than being attacked by an unkillable puppet, but she never thought the puppeteer would be Steve Rogers.</p><p>She reveals her plan to kill him, which includes dismembering him and putting the parts in a cement-filled steel casket, which she will weld shut and drop into the Atlantic. Wade recovers a bit, spitting out blood and says he made a mistake ever trying to be good -nothing that all anyone wants him for is dirty jobs. He tells Preston she made a mistake getting too close. He reveals a grenade, which he uses to blow them up together. He's healing factor has him recover sooner, and he begins destroying Preston's LMD body. She reactivates in the middle, which Wade says wasn't supposed to happen. Preston curses him, saying he'll burn in Hell and Wade sadly agrees, before finishing her off. Her body now destroyed, she lies motionless on the ground, with Wade staring down at her sadly.</p><p>He's shown having boxed up the parts and taking them to be shipped somewhere. He tells the P.O. worker that he will be killed if his package is mishandled, before leaving. He's then shown at the Preston's house, dragging Ellie away from her family, despite her protests. Terry wants Wade to talk to him and asks him what happened to Emily. Wade just says she went underground, before riding off with a confused Ellie.</p><p>In the present, the lead Hydra agent wonders what Wade's plan is for capturing Maria Hill, and he says he'll do so by serving up Steve Rogers.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Powers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2302523\" data-ratio=\"1.386524822695\" data-width=\"282\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 282px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2302523\"><img alt=\"Statistics.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-width=\"282\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg 282w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Statistics.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30760/2302523-43_deadpool.jpg 282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px\" data-width=\"282\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Statistics.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Enhanced regeneration/healing factor:</strong> Deadpool's primary ability is an extremely accelerated healing factor, derived from the mutant Wolverine and given to him by Weapon X.

Unlike Wolverine's, however, his is driven to a certain extent by willpower, which provides an advantage in certain situations.

While not as strong as Captain America (whose maximum bench press over 1800lbs), Wade can readily lift/press approximately 1000 lbs, and has the stamina to perform feats of strength for extended periods of time.</li><li><b>Superhuman stamina: </b>Due to his healing factor, Wade's body produces less fatigue toxins and gets rid of existing ones much quicker than that of a normal human's, which allows him to exert himself for much longer than humanly possible.</li><li><strong>Superhuman reflexes/agility/speed:</strong> Deadpool's speed, reflexes and agility are highly enhanced, and he has coordination and speed to go toe-to-toe with many skilled fighters at once and not lose, clear a room in a few jumps, and perform complicated acrobatic manouvres with ease. He's shown to easily dodge bullets at close range, disarm opponents without them even being aware of what has happened, and has deflected bullets with his katana at point blank range. His speed is such that he can dodge bullets after they've been fired (and move out of the way while it is only inches away from his face).</li><li><strong>Immortality: </strong>When Thanos found out that Deadpool and Mistress Death share a romantic relationship between the two of them, he cursed Deadpool with immortality, meaning that he can't die by any means.</li></ul><h3>Abilities</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249707\" data-ratio=\"1.215\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-249707\"><img alt=\"Deadpool running.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Deadpool running.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/249707-21063-deadpool.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px\" data-width=\"526\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Deadpool running.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Master martial artist:</strong> Deadpool is a highly skilled martial artist, and is able to easily engage highly-trained foes such as Wolverine or multiple ninjas in combat with ease.

This trend started in the late '90s when it was made popular by <a href=\"../../joe-kelly/26-40982/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe Kelly</a>. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall by talking about his own comic (sometimes even having copies of it somehow), referring to artists or writers or even the reader, and discussing comics in general. He is most known for, however, talking to the yellow narration bubbles that his comic has. There have been several theories as to what the boxes really are but no one other than Deadpool can see them in continuity and therefore many people in the Marvel Universe think Deadpool is crazy. Deadpool also references popular media culture in the comics such as video games, celebrities, social networking, and what's going on with the real world at the time. <ul><li><strong>Minor reality manipluation:</strong> Due to his ability to realize he is in a fictional world, Deadpool can perform actions that directly defy the rules of reality and physics - for example, he uses a bottomless satchel to store an infinite amount of ammuniation, weaponry, and other such objects. In <em>Ultimate Alliance 2</em>, Deadpool weaponizes his own health bar to beat an opponent with it. Deadpool also posesses knowledge that only a comic book reader could know, such as mentioning Mephisto erasing Spider-Man's unmasking from existance, or remembering which comic issue a character last appeared in.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Weapons and Equipment</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-654875\" data-ratio=\"1.8432203389831\" data-width=\"236\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 236px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:184.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-654875\"><img alt=\"Swingers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg 236w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Swingers.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/19940/654875-deadpool_03.jpg 236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px\" data-width=\"236\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Swingers.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Teleporter:</strong> Deadpool used different types of teleportation devices designed by his weapon dealer, Weasel.

Dead Man Wade was psychotically depressed and a serial killer. He wasn't only just constantly healing like 616 Deadpool, but he was constantly decaying too. This makes him wish for death for he is constantly in pain. His teammate Danielle liked to hurt him and see how he recovered, her actions made Damask killed her.</p><p>When <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> ordered the Pale Riders to destroy the sanctuary of <a href=\"../../avalon/34-41283/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avalon</a> he is betrayed by <a href=\"../../damask/29-14848/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damask</a>.

This version of Deadpool never got cancer or went to the Weapon-X program. He joined the Avengers calling himself the <a href=\"../../swordsman/29-3795/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swordsman</a>, and would later become their leader. He was calmer, level-headed, and stern. He also carried a wide array of swords with him. He eventually uncovers the fact that their universe is actually a lie. This sends him into a spiraling depression. He gains a massive amount of weight and becomes suicidal. He eventually decides to try to destroy their \"pocket universe\" as it is a mockery of their existence.</p><h3>Millennial Visions</h3><p>Millennial Visions' Deadpool was hired by <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> to kill the X-Men. Shaw was so happy with Deadpool's success that he hired Deadpool to kill all the mutants.

He did fight with Wolverine but could not kill him, Wolverine did lose an arm in the fight however and Deadpool used his claw as a weapon thereafter. Deadpool kept pictures and souvenirs from all of his targets.

During World War 2, he's convinced by Nazis to become a German super soldier and is given increased physical abilities and rapid healing as well as increased resilience to wounds due to his scabbed and callous skin - he's dubbed \"Weapon Swastika.\" He's then sent to steal Captain America's would-be shield during the forging process, but decides that he's not a traitor and goes rogue.

In this reality Deadpool works with General Cable who hired him to track down the rogue agent Outlaw and stop her. At first it’s seen that Deadpool and Cable were war buddies from WWII, but in truth they were both brainwashed to become sleeper agents for General Stryfe and a secret organization with goal of world domination. When Stryfe ordered Deadpool to kill <a href=\"../../john-f-kennedy/29-33077/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Senator John F. Kennedy</a> he was able to break free of the mind control after which he saved Cable, stopped both Stryfe and Outlaw, and delayed the explosion of a nuclear device. While the city was saved the bomb blew up underwater, and while escaping, Deadpool was caught in the explosion which resulted in his scarring and cancer. In recovery Cable offered to help Deadpool and offered him to join a new program, Weapon X.</p><h3>Earth-5021</h3><p>Deadpool of Earth-5021 was unhinged from time and forced to become a member of the <a href=\"../../exiles/65-19986/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exiles</a>' rival reality-hopping group known as <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-50418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a>, which performed morally challenging tasks. He acted similar to Earth-616 Deadpool, but was less erratic and more bloodthirsty. After being apparently killed by Sabretooth, he was put in stasis at the <a href=\"../../timebroker/29-20085/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timebroker</a>s' base where he was freed by <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Strange</a> whom realized that Deadpool was alive. Deadpool then killed him and attempted to take over the Timebroker's headquarters with other Weapon-X members. During the conflict, <a href=\"../../mimic/29-12546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mimic</a> absorbed his healing factor powers (and couldn't get rid of it), and then was apparently killed by She-Hulk.</p><h3>Earth-9997</h3><p>Thing suspected that Deadpool took the identity of <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a>, who is dead in the <a href=\"../../earth-x/39-44571/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth X</a> reality, and became a stuntman in a traveling show. The man denies being Deadpool though.</p><h3>Earth-811</h3><p>After the original <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> are hunted down and killed by <a href=\"../../maverick/29-8307/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agent Zero</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a> makes a new team of X-men. Deadpool is one of people recruited. Deadpool at first turns him down but after getting in several fights by the side of Wolverine he realizes it might be fun and he eventually changes his mind. He remarks about how Wolverine only wants him so he can be the \"token human\" of the team. This Deadpool makes several pop culture references just like earth 616 does. Wolverine beings to question his decision to extend an invitation but after Deadpool single-handedly takes down several assassins he knows he made the right choice. While training however Agent Zero again tracks them down and Deadpool is apparently killed when he melts into sort of goop after Agent Zero attacks him with a corrosive weapon that has an attribute that works best against those with a healing factor.</p><h3>5 Ronin Universe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1788961\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0601443464314\" data-width=\"1247\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1247px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1788961\"><img alt=\"Ronin Deadpool\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 1247w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 603w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ronin Deadpool\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 1247w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/60672/1788961-5r_5_legion_cps_001.jpg 603w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ronin Deadpool</figcaption></figure><p>In this universe Deadpool is named Watari and is a homeless person, who many consider a fool.

Then Deadpool and Domino escaped which then revealed that all of this wasn't real, that Wade Wilson is the man the judge explained earlier and that the judge was actually a worker for the mental asylum Wade was in.</p><h3>Earth 615.9: Venompool</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2659191\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5188888888889\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2659191\"><img alt=\"Venompool\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Venompool\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/13/134997/2659191-venom_face.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Venompool</figcaption></figure><p>\"What If Venom Possessed Deadpool?\" is an issue that took place in the 1980s, Deadpool was hired by <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> to kill the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">Beyonder</a> for merging Galactus's body with <a href=\"/head-case/4005-77138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77138\">M.O.D.O.K.</a> So Deadpool accepted for the price of the continuity cube.

As Weapon XI, his mouth is stitched closed, all visible hair is gone, and stitch marks are still present, as he had been taken out of his procedure early to fight Wolverine. He is also infused with a variety of superpowers as a result of being given DNA injections from the various mutants Stryker had kidnapped. He is never exactly called Deadpool in the movie, however Stryker once refers to him as \"the Dead Pool\" in the movie.

      "deck": "Samuel Sterns was a worker in a chemical plant in a menial capacity until an accident ",
      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>When an ordinary laborer was moving a load of waste material in the sub-cellar of a chemical research plant, a one-in-a-million freak accident occurred as an experimental gamma ray cylinder exploded.The trapped laborer was helplessly caught in the blast. For about a minute his entire body was bombarded by the mysterious gamma rays, one of the strongest forces known to man. Although a fraction of the dosage he received would have been enough to kill a dozen men, for some inexplicable reason the laborer survived. He seem completely unharmed.</p><p>Yet, he was different. After leaving the observation ward, he read every book he could find. He studied like a man possessed and remembered everything he read. His mind absorbed knowledge like a sponge. A few days later, the long-term effects of the gamma rays finally took place and he went unconscious. When he awoke, he did not suspect what happened to him, but when he looked into the mirror, he knew that he had become something more than human. The once unskilled laborer had been transformed by the gamma rays into one of the greatest brains that ever lived. \"My former name is meaningless now! I choose to be known simply as... <b>The Leader</b>!\"</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Hulk's Nemesis</h3><p>As the Leader, he became one of the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk'</a>s deadliest villains, choosing to manipulate others into fighting for him rather than confronting the Hulk himself. When Leader began losing his enhanced intelligence he promised the Hulk that he would help him find a way to be the Hulk full time if he helped him regain his lost intellect. Leader used a device created by Banner that siphoned all of the excess radiation out of the body of the Hulk's sidekick <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a>' body into his own.</p><p>The device worked but it left Leader even more mutated than before and he now had a mental link with Rick Jones. In an attempt to gain more test subjects for his experiments, Leader detonates a controlled gamma bomb in a small town in <a href=\"/arizona/4020-55753/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55753\">Arizona</a> which killed over 5000 people. The blast seemingly killed the Hulk and created five new superhuman enforcers whom he used to build the hidden society called Freehold in the Arctic.</p><p>When the Hulk is poisoned Leader supplies him with information about his brother, the <a href=\"/mad-man/4005-50983/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50983\">Madman</a>. He wants the Hulk to put Madman out of his misery because he felt that after his brother's breakdown he was only suffering. When <a href=\"/marlo-jones/4005-10860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10860\">Marlo</a> dies, Leader sets about reviving her because of the pain he starts feeling do to the mental link with her boyfriend Rick Jones. Leader is killed in a battle with the Hulk shortly after he revives Marlo, but it is revealed that his mind had evolved beyond the need for a body and his mind survived. After his apparent death, the Leader's right hand man <a href=\"/omnibus/4005-25073/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25073\">Omnibus</a> is placed in charge of Freehold where he tries to incite a nuclear war and the Leader begins to haunt him by temporarily possessing his body causing him to become increasingly paranoid. Omnibus is sentenced to death and is eaten by a polar bear after his schemes are exposed.</p><h3>Intelligencia</h3><p>At some point, the Leader begins to recruit other villains of intellect in order to combat their foes. Along with the <a href=\"/wizard/4005-3287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3287\">Wizard</a>, the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\">Mad Thinker</a>, <a href=\"/red-ghost/4005-2473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2473\">Red Ghost</a> and <a href=\"/egghead/4005-3797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3797\">Egghead</a> he forms the super group the <a href=\"/intelligencia/4060-56959/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56959\">Intelligencia</a>. They also gain the cooperation of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>. Together they plan to restore the information of the Library of Alexandria by stealing the info from various sources across the world.</p><p>After finally obtaining all the necessary information, the Leader and the others are betrayed by Doctor Doom. The Leader knows that they cannot hope to defeat Doom on his own land and retreats from the battle. He disappears for some time, putting himself deep in thought. He is then found by <a href=\"/modok/4005-3709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3709\">MODOK</a> to reform the team.</p><h3>Red Hulk</h3><p>MODOK had developed a way to finally defeat the Hulk: create their own Hulk. Although this <a href=\"/red-hulk/4005-56974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56974\">Red Hulk</a> is eventually cast from their plans, the Leader creates a <a href=\"/red-she-hulk/4005-65529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65529\">Red She-Hulk</a> to help assist them. They begin to formulate a plan to remove any other threats from their way. They determine which eight of Earth's greatest intellects would stand against them and attack the smartest first. They soon use the cathexis ray (with red hulk attached) to \"hulkify\" most of the super heroes and their personal army, the AIMarines into \"hulked-out\" versions of their selves. Soon Bruce finds Leader and starts beating him down. He prepares to kill him but Leader escapes. After Bruce Banner saves the eight smartest men, they build a machine that absorb the gamma radiation from the hero and the AIMarines and transfers it into Banner, changing them back to normal. The Leader is soon caught up with the Red Hulk who drains the gamma radiation out of him, removing his powers. The Leader begs for Red Hulk to kill him but Red Hulk replies \"Not a chance\".</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>After his radioactive accident, Sterns underwent a transformation that severely increased his intelligence. The potential of his intelligence is nearly unlimited. It is assumed that he can think above and beyond the normal human spectrum of thought (example. Possibly comprehending 4 dimensions etc.). This great intelligence allows him to predict possibilities and outcomes with extreme accuracy. It flirts with the abilities of precognition or extra-sensory perception. In other words, his assumptions are almost always correct. It is also said that the Leader has a perfect memory with the ability to recall any event after his radioactive accident.</p><p>Sterns has also demonstrated the ability to control minds with his psionic powers. This power works in the same fashion as dominate mind/person, allowing Sterns to turn humans into puppets of his will.</p><p>With his increased intelligence and comprehension, Sterns has created a number of weapons that are far beyond those on earth. These advanced weapons have aided him in his nefarious plans of corporate domination.</p><p>After he absorbed all of the radiation from the body of Rick Jones they developed a mental link which the Leader used to his advantage.</p><h2>Obsession</h2><p>Like most evil geniuses Sterns is somewhat obsessed with defeating his nemesis the Incredible Hulk. So much that many of his plans are foiled simply because he had some how angered or enticed the Hulk to enter the fray. It is a continual goal for Sterns to best or exploit the Hulk and, despite his infinite intelligence and supreme knowledge, his arrogance and hatred of the Hulk is usually his undoing.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p><b>Ultimate (1616)</b></p><p>Samuel Sterns appears in <a href=\"/ultimate-enemy/4050-31298/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-31298\">Ultimate Enemy</a> as a member of <a href=\"/roxxon/4060-56010/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56010\">Roxxon</a> Corp's brain trust. He brings up the idea that all the attacks are just a distraction to steal the items stored at <a href=\"/project-pegasus/4020-44379/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44379\">Project PEGASUS</a>. After the rest of the brain trust are webbed up by<a href=\"/black-widow-clone/4005-75700/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75700\"> Spider-Woman</a> when they questioned who she really was, Sterns transforms into a hulk like creature and takes Spider-Woman down.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><b><a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4025-45/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-45\">The Incredible Hulk</a> (2008)</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101568/2202279-samuel_sterns__movieearth_199999_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202279\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4005847953216\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101568/2202279-samuel_sterns__movieearth_199999_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202279\"><img alt=\"Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101568/2202279-samuel_sterns__movieearth_199999_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101568/2202279-samuel_sterns__movieearth_199999_.jpg 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" data-width=\"342\"></a><figcaption>Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns</figcaption></figure><p>Samuel Sterns appears in the film, portrayed by Tim Blake Nelson. In a departure from the comics, this version of Sterns is a good-natured scientist and university professor who seeks to help cure Bruce Banner.</p><p>Dr. Sterns acts as a contact over the computer for Bruce Banner while he is on the lam, making attempts to find a cure for Bruce's \"condition\". When no cure can be found, Sterns asks him to meet with him in hopes of change. When Bruce and Betty meet with him, he runs the procedure with a special serum where the results could vary due to its toxicity. The test seems to be a success, but Sterns tells Bruce and Betty that he has mass produced Bruce's gamma-irradiated blood. Bruce demands that Sterns destroy it all in fear that the military will use it as a weapon, but are ambushed by General Ross's men and Emil Blonsky. Blonsky, desperate for the Hulk's power, forces Sterns to recreate the experiment that created the Hulk, but when Sterns notices that he has been injected with some enhancements already (a super soldier serum), he warns Blonsky that the mixture could result in \"an abomination\", but Blonsky still plans to go through with it. Sterns watches in fear as Blonsky transforms into the Hulk-like creature, who strikes Sterns, knocking him out. While unconscious, a sample of Bruce's blood falls into an open wound in his temple, causing his cranium to begin expanding, and recovers with a mischievous grin. This was meant to tease a sequel that would feature Sterns becoming the Leader, but the follow-up was never made.</p><h3>Television</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757441-leader2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757441\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757441-leader2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757441\"><img alt=\"The Leader in EMH\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81965/1757441-leader2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757441-leader2.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81965/1757441-leader2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Leader in EMH</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The Leader appeared in<a href=\"/the-marvel-super-heroes/4075-322/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-322\"><em> The Marvel Super Heroes</em></a>, voiced by Gillie Fenwick.</li><li>The Leader appeared in the 80s <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4075-144/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-144\"><em>Incredible Hulk</em></a> animated series, voiced by Stan Jones.</li><li>The Leader appeared in the Iron Man: The Animated Series episode \"Hulkbuster,\" voiced by Matt Frewer.</li><li>The Leader appeared as a recurring villain in the 90s <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4075-97/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-97\"><em>Incredible Hulk</em></a> animated series, with Matt Frewer reprising his role.</li><li>The Leader appeared as a recurring villain in <a href=\"/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/4075-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-18\"><em>The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em></a>, voiced by Jeffrey Combs.</li><li>The Leader appeared in <a href=\"/hulk-and-the-agents-of-s-m-a-s-h/4075-34/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-34\"><em>Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.</em></a>, <a href=\"/ultimate-spiderman/4075-13/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-13\"><em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em></a> and <a href=\"/avengers-assemble/4075-19/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-19\"><em>Avengers Assemble</em></a>, voiced by James Arnold Taylor.</li><li>The Leader appears in <em>Marvel Future Avengers</em>, voiced by Yoshihito Sasaki in the Japanese original and by Ben Diskin in the English dub.</li></ul><h3>Video Games</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6383090\" data-ratio=\"0.48\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 625px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6383090\"><img alt=\"The Leader in the 2003 Hulk game\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg 625w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Leader in the 2003 Hulk game\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg 625w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6383090-leader%20game.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Leader in the 2003 Hulk game</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The Leader appears in the 1994 <em>Incredible Hulk</em> game.</li><li>The Leader appears as an enemy in the<em> Hulk</em> video game, which is set after the events of the <a href=\"/hulk/4025-44/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-44\">2003 film</a>.

Shunned by his fellow gods and even his own father <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\"> Zeus </a>as one of the most hateful<a href=\"/the-olympians/4060-56540/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56540\"> Olympians</a>, Ares constantly yearned to serve alongside the \"Gods of Light\" who ruled atop<a href=\"/mount-olympus/4020-55708/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55708\"> Mount Olympus</a>. During the Trojan War, in which the Mycenaean Greeks attacked the city of Troy in Asia Minor during the 13th century B.C., Ares initially fought on behalf of the Trojans; battling the Greek warrior<a href=\"/diomedes/4005-20660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20660\"> Diomedes</a>, he was repelled by <a href=\"/athena/4005-13902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13902\">Athena</a>, who had guided Diomedes' sword. Ares later rejoined the battle and stood alongside the Greek warrior Achilles, serving as the demigod's patron lord of war ever since. With the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the 4th century A.D., Zeus allowed the worship of the Olympians to die out, forbidding Ares to act as the patron god of warriors and causing dissastisfaction with Zeus's rule over the centuries. At some point the ancient goddess<a href=\"/nox/4005-27793/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27793\"> Nox </a>posed as<a href=\"/venus/4005-12632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12632\"> Venus</a>, seducing Ares and then bearing his children, <a href=\"/deimos/4005-27796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27796\">Deimos </a>and <a href=\"/phobos/4005-45219/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45219\">Phobos</a>.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Rivalry with Hercules</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-270694\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/270694-71349-hercules.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/270694-71349-hercules.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-270694\"><img alt=\" Ares and his brother Hercules\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/270694-71349-hercules.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/270694-71349-hercules.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" data-width=\"465\"></a><figcaption> Ares and his brother Hercules</figcaption></figure><p>Ares's enmity towards his half-brother Hercules extends as far back as the latter's mortal days. Hercules came into conflict with Ares's son Kyknos, who waylaid travelers and was using their skulls to construct a temple dedicated to the God of War. Not wishing to see his son slain at the hands of Hercules, Ares descended from Mount Olympus and engaged his half-brother in combat. With the aid of Athena, Hercules was able to wound the God of War, thus driving him from the battlefield and allowing Hercules to defeat and subsequently kill the son of Ares. Ares has never forgiven Hercules for this slight.</p><p>In modern times, when <a href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\">Pluto </a>tricked <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules i</a>nto taking his place as Lord of Hades, Hercules sought his half-brother Ares' help. Hating Hercules' blustering manner and close relationship with Zeus, Ares refused, but the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Asgardian </a>thunder god <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor </a>helped release Hercules from Pluto's contract.</p><p>Later, Ares and Asgardian sorceress <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Amora the Enchantress </a>tricked Hercules into drinking from the Fountain of Eros, compelling him to fall madly in love with Amora. The Enchantress pitted Hercules against the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, who soon released him from her spell; however, Ares had already convinced Zeus that Hercules had renounced his Olympian heritage for the love of an Asgardian, and Zeus banished Hercules from Olympus for a year. Joining the Avengers during his exile on Earth, Hercules eventally helped free the Olympians, whom Typhon the Titan had banished to the Land of Shades by extinguishing the Promethean Flame which sustained them; Zeus forgave Hercules and ended his exile, infuriating Ares.</p><h3>Coming of the Warhawk</h3><p>Once again allied with the Enchantress, Ares used <a href=\"/merlyn/4005-14820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14820\"> Merlin's </a>cursed<a href=\"/ebony-blade/4055-46939/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46939\"> Ebony Blade</a> to extinguish the Promethean Flame and transform the Olympian gods to crystal; this did not affect demigods such as Hercules, whom Ares threw off Mount Olympus. Ares then traveled to Earth as \"Mr. Tallon\" and founded the militant Warhawk organization, using the entrancing music of Olympian satyrs to incite his followers to violence in hopes of creating a nuclear war that would open a portal to the halls of <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\"> Asgard</a>. When the Avengers thwarted his plan, Ares fled to Olympus and had an amnesiac Hercules brought there. As a small strike force of <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers </a>stormed Olympus to stop Ares, his hordes of Olympian beasts and demigods invaded Earth, where the remaining Avengers opposed them until Ares was defeated and forced to return the Ebony Blade to the <a href=\"/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\"> Black Knight</a>. <a href=\"/venus/4005-12632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12632\"> Venus </a>angered Ares when she visited Earth, seeking to avert a war he had engineered. She teamed with<a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\"> Namor the Sub-Mariner</a> to defeat Ares, weakening him with rays emitted by her enchanted girdle Cestus and forcing him to end the war and return to Olympus. Ares next plotted with<a href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\"> Pluto </a>to start a war between <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\"> Asgard </a>and <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\"> Olympus </a>by abducting the Asgardian valkyrior<a href=\"/krista/4005-33092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33092\"> Krista </a>while disguised as Hercules and absconding with her to Hades. After the witch Chaga told Thor and Hercules that Ares was the culprit, they defeated him at the Gates of Hades and rescued Krista from Pluto's clutches.</p><h3>Pluto, God of War</h3><p>Later, when a newly formed alliance with his fellow<a href=\"/hell-lords/4060-52713/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-52713\"> Hell-lords</a> gave<a href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\"> Pluto </a>the power to challenge<a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\"> Olympus</a>, he demanded that Zeus arrange marriages of Venus and Hercules to Ares and Amazon Queen <a href=\"/hippolyta/4005-13907/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13907\"> Hippolyta</a>, both trusted friends of<a href=\"/hades/4005-70048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70048\"> Hades</a>; since Olympian law forbade acting against one's own spouse, this double marriage would have constrained the only two Olympians capable of preventing Pluto's planned takeover of Olympus. The Olympian <a href=\"/huntsman/4005-41076/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41076\"> Huntsman </a>and the Titan<a href=\"/menoetius/4005-62903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62903\"> Menoetius</a> were dispatched to bring Venus and Hercules to Olympus, where Zeus reluctantly decreed that they be married to Ares and Hippolyta. After the heroic <a href=\"/champions/4060-40413/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40413\"> Champions </a>of Los Angeles interrupted the ceremony and informed Zeus of Pluto's plan to overthrow him, Zeus called off the weddings and banished Pluto.</p><h3>Wager with Hera</h3><p>Ares next entered a wager with his mother, <a href=\"/hera/4005-13898/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13898\"> Hera</a>, to see who could bring the most sorrow to Hercules' life. Jealous of Hercules' friendship with the Avengers, Ares possessed the body of the<a href=\"/thunderstrike/4005-7611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7611\"> new Thor</a> and attacked Hercules in an attempt to force his half-brother to kill his friend; but a lightning bolt summoned by Thor's hammer exposed Ares' involvement and ruined his plan. Ares later conspired with Pluto to kill a temporarily insane<a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\"> Thor</a>; however, Thor's madness made him a fiercer combatant, and he savagely defeated Ares. Pluto returned to Olympus with the wounded Ares and informed Zeus that Thor had attacked them without provocation; but the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\"> Asgardian </a>shield maiden <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\"> Sif </a>refuted this allegation and challenge Pluto to trial by combat before appealing to Ares' sense of warrior's honor convincing him to reveal the truth.</p><p>Hera later enacted her half of the wager with Ares by impersonating Hercules' ex-girlfriend <a href=\"/taylor-madison/4005-48456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48456\"> Taylor Madison</a>. Hoping to win his father's good graces, Ares informed Zeus of this; Ares and Zeus then descended to Earth, exposing Hera's scheme before she could kill the<a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers </a>and revealing that the original Taylor Madison was merely a magical construct created by Zeus to force Hera's hand.</p><h3>Ares and The Heart of Athena</h3><p>Ares next returned to Earth to reorganize the Warhawks as a terrorist organization, slaughtering diplomats at international peace and economic summits in order to exploit their deaths and ignite the flames of global war. He attacked Hercules at the New York Museum of Greek Antiquity in order to draw his half-brother into conflict and steal the Heart of <a href=\"/athena/4005-13902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13902\"> Athena</a>, an ancient artifact empowered by Zeus that geometrically magnified any force projected through it.</p><p>Hercules immediately accepted an offer to join<a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\"> SHIELD </a>in order to stop his brother; but while Hercules and his SHIELD strike force raided Ares' base in the jungles of South America, Ares and his Warkhawks took control of a SHIELD helicarrier. Ares used the Heart of Athena to construct a sonic canon known as the Gabriel Horn aboard the<a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\"> Helicarrier</a>, which was intended to cause the structural breakdown of all metal on Earth so that society would devolve into warring feudal clans; however, Hercules and his SHIELD allies defeated Ares before the Gabriel Horn could be activated.</p><h3>God of War: No More!</h3><p>When <a href=\"/pluto/4005-2636/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2636\">Pluto </a>again sought to conquer Olympus, the battle between Pluto and the Olympians had reached a stalemate until Zeus summoned Ares to turn the tide in the Olympians' favor. Ares crushed Pluto's hellish armies, dismembering the bodies of the fallen enemy soldiers so that they would never be complete, even in death; but when Ares returned to Olympus expecting to be accepted by his fellow Olympians at last, he learned that his brethen still looked down upon him and deeply regretted having needed Ares' assistance to win the war. Dejected, Ares finally realized he would never be considered one of Olympus' Gods of Light and abandoned his duties as God of War.</p><h3>A Human Life</h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-112024\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/112024-16227-ares.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.515\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/112024-16227-ares.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-112024\"><img alt=\"Ares Returns\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/308/112024-16227-ares.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/308/112024-16227-ares.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Ares Returns</figcaption></figure><p>Ares own mini-series starts with Ares contemplating his life, The gods of Olympus wished to have nothing do with him and he loathed what he had become. He decided to leave and live a relatively peaceful life on earth with his son, Alexander (better known as<a href=\"/phobos/4005-45219/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45219\"> Phobos</a>). Alexander knew nothing about his fathers former life as the god of war, nor did Ares want him to find out. But one day <a href=\"/hermes/4005-13903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13903\"> Hermes </a>paid Ares a visit with a message from for him, they needed his help once again to fight off a new threat, <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\"> Amatsu Mikaboshi</a>, the Japanese god of evil. But Ares had not forgotten the treatment they gave him and refused to come to their aid. Zeus had Alexander kidnapped to force Ares to pick up his old ways and come to . After a furious outbreak on earth hurting some police officers. Achilles comes to him and tells him why they’ve done this, Asgard had been destroyed and would be to, they could not hold out for much longer. For his son he agreed to return with Achilles but when arriving at the building where his son was kept in safety was destroyed and there was no sign of Ares son anywhere. Alexander was taken by Mikaboshi and showed him who his father truly was, and who he really was so he would fight for him.</p><p>Alexander’s mind was poisoned somehow with a drink which him furious at his father. In the meantime Ares agreed to fight with Zeus against the invader but only to regain his son. At the walls of Olympus began their final battle. Ares fought valiantly side by side with the Olympians to secure the safety of and retrieve his son from the hands of Mikaboshi. While Zeus was leading his troops he spotted what seemed to be Alexander in the battlefield. He races towards him to protect him but he was tricked, it was not truly Alexander but it was Mikaboshi who pretended to be him. Mikaboshi managed to mortally wound Zeus and take him out of the battle. Enraged by this, the two brothers Ares and Hercules fought with Mikaboshi and managed to make him retreat. They returned to to heal Zeus and are greeted by Inari, a messenger from the remaining gods of the east.</p><p>They will help him if they ask but Ares refuses to beg for help, the messenger asks for a bit of water to quench his thirst and then leaves. But in secret he goes to his gods and says that this water had been offered by whom requested their help. From here the story skips five years into the future where a large battle is being held at the Mammoths gate, the gates that guards Japan’s hell and behind them, Mikaboshi. Ares finally faces his son Alexander, but his mind is clouded and attacks Ares ramming a sword into his fathers body. In the meantime Zeus and Apollo get wounded in battle which enrages Zeus seeing his three sons wounded. He shows a magnificent display of power but is mortally wounded once more by Mikaboshi. With one final act he lifts the spell of Alexander, seeing what he just did to his own father Alexander goes into a rage and attacks Mikaboshi for what he had done to him. In the meantime the gods of the east arrive on the battlefield to aid the Olympians. They wash away the evil with a giant wave while Alexander kills Mikaboshi. The evil army had been defeated and Alexander was once more Ares’s son.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><p>Still insistent that Alexander have a mortal upbringing, Ares returned to his life as a construction worker in Dover, New Jersey, where he worked at the time of the enactment of the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Superhuman Registration Act</a>. Immediately following the super hero <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Civil War </a>over this legislation, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man </a>and <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel </a>travelled to Ares' construction site to recruit him for their <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/4060-46148/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46148\">Avengers </a>team. Angered that the heroes had ruined his civilian cover, Ares eventually agreed to join the team after Iron Man threatened to deport him to Olympus if he did not register with the U.S. Government.</p><h3>Ares: The Mighty Avenger</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462982\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5209125475285\" data-width=\"526\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 526px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462982\"><img alt=\" Ares and his fellow Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 526w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 420w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Ares and his fellow Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 526w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/77/462982-mightavn006_colv2.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" data-width=\"420\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Ares and his fellow Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Ares joined with Tony Stark's <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/4060-46148/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46148\">Avengers</a>.

Ares and Pym's efforts helped turn the battle in the Avengers' favour, and Ultron was once again defeated. Ares continued to fight valiantly alongside the Avengers against threats from the <a href=\"/mole-man/4005-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2481\">Mole Man</a>, <a href=\"/tiger-shark/4005-6815/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6815\">Tiger Shark</a>, a <a href=\"/symbiotes/4060-56880/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56880\">symbiote </a>assimilation, the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>, the time-displaced <a href=\"/invaders/4060-25865/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\">Invaders</a>, and the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">renegade band of heroes operating underground</a>. However, Ares was reckless and hungry for action and on one occasion betrayed the team to get revenge on his brother <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>.</p><p>The Avengers launched an assault on <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom </a>and <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>, who they discovered was responsible for the \"<a href=\"/venom-bomb/4045-56016/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56016\">Venom Bomb</a>\" that had disrupted New York and temporarily fell many of the Avengers. While the team entered Latveria, Ares flew the Avengers <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">Quinjet </a>straight into <a href=\"/castle-doom/4020-41453/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41453\">Castle Doom</a>, in the battle that ensued, Doom managed to capture the Avengers. Upon capturing the team, Doom soon realized that Ares was in fact the son of <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>. While Doom had no qualms with executing the rest of the team, Doom refused to kill Ares out of fear of the wrath of the Gods if he were to kill Zeus' son. Doom wished for Ares to return to contact Zeus and return to Olympus so that he could do whatever he wished with the remaining Avengers. Ares, fearful of his father, refused. While Doom was stalemated, <a href=\"/queen-veranke/4005-54514/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54514\">Spider-Woman </a>managed to use some of her <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull </a>powers to free herself and her fellow Avengers from their shackles, and Ares instantly launched an attack on his oppressor. Ares insisted Doom was a \"coward\" for attempting to escape, and with the help of his team-mate the <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a>, Ares defeated Doom and for the first time in Avengers history... the Avengers had beat Doctor Doom.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>When the team of <a href=\"/captain-americas-resistance/4060-58900/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58900\">outlaw Avengers </a>stole one of the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers </a><a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">Quinjets </a>to investigate a <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull </a>ship that had crash landed in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, the Avengers followed them to reclaim the Quinjet and arrest the team.

He did not understand why his former team leader, Carol Danvers (<a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\"> Ms. Marvel</a>) was against working for Osborn. He viewed his new alliance with the ex-villain simply as continuing the fight that the original Mighty Avengers had started on terrorist-level superhuman, and natural threats against America and even the entire planet. Ares now fights with the<a href=\"/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\"> Dark Avengers</a> headed by Norman Osborn. Ares views his alliance with the Dark Avengers as continuing the fight alongside the Mighty Avengers against superhuman and natural threats against the world.</p><p>The first mission of Ares and the rest of the Dark Avengers was to assist Doctor Doom and the rest of <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\"> Latveria</a> who, at that moment, were under attack by <a href=\"/morgan-le-fay/4005-13925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13925\"> Morgan Le Fay</a>. As the Dark Avengers arrived in Latveria, they saw Victor knocked out cold on the floor. Upon seeing Morgan Le Fey, Osborn tells Sentry to go all out. Sentry easily rips off Morgan's head and the Dark Avengers seemed successful in their first mission until Sentry started to scream and subsequently exploded. After it cleared, Morgan Le Fay was seen back and Sentry was gone. Ares confronts Morgan and tells her that he is the God of War and son of Zeus and demands that she goes back to the time she came from. Morgan then casts a spell that turns <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\"> Mac Gargan</a> (<a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\"> Venom</a>) crazy and he tries to eat Ares.

Upon returning to America, he intervenes in a somewhat childish argument between <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\"> Bullseye</a> and Venom, in which he backhands Bullseye for acting like a child, causing a grudge to form. He later returns to his home in the Bronx where he discovers his son missing, and multiple truancy notices in his room.</p><p>Ares is next seen in the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a>/Avengers crossover event, <a href=\"/utopia/4045-55905/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55905\"> Utopia</a>, where he jumps in front of San Francisco City Hall in order to defend it from rioters, warning both sides to stay away, for coming too close will incur his wrath.

Ares follows their scooter on his motorcycle to their headquarters. Breaking in, Ares is immediately confronted by member of the Secret Warriors, <a href=\"/hellfire/4005-54526/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54526\"> Hellfire</a>. Ares easily dispatches of the young hero, though.

Ares doesn't fight anymore as he wishes Alex to make his own choices and to be better father than Zeus was to him.</p><p>Ares talks to Norman and he is informed by him that he is making a list.

He picks four of agents who he will specially train as his team of \"Shades.\" He personally subjects them to a rigorous training regimen, parts of which include live fire exercises in which Ares uses real weapons against them as they navigate a series of obstacles. He instills in them an attitude of superiority even among their fellow soldiers and encourages them engage in bar brawls and drinking games. All of this forges them into an elite unit, utterly loyal to Ares, a sentiment Ares reciprocates.</p><p>During this time, Ares is approached by his mother, Hera, informing him that his son has been hurt. Ares assumes she means Phobos and takes his \"shades\" to go and attack Nick Fury and his team of Secret Warriors. Upon entering the hideout, it is revealed that it is not in fact Phobos, but his other son, Kyknos. Freed from death and arm and armored with Ares's own discarded weapons and armor, Kyknos had been promised the mantle of the God of War provided he was able to kill Ares and claim it. The trap sprung, Kyknos unleashed Ares's other 'children', include the Mares of Diomedes and a seemingly endless horde of skeletal warriors. While his shades managed to escape, Ares himself was captured as he covered the escape of his men. Refusing to leave the commander they had grown to respect, The Shades staged a rescue mission, hiding in the entrails of a dead animal and attacking with all their fire power. In the end Ares was rescued and, in proving that he was the true God Of War, killed his son, just as Hercules had done millennia ago. However, all his Shades had been killed.</p><p>The rest of the Dark Avengers arrived to find Ares sitting on the thrown built by Kyknos, his slain men arranged in front of him. When Osborn tried to chide Ares he shot him down and remarked \"you wanted me to teach them everything the God Of War knows. Well, they've learned it now\".</p><h3>Siege</h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295214\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.7822265625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1295214\"><img alt=\"Death of Ares\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of Ares\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/69895/1295214-sentry_kills_ares.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death of Ares</figcaption></figure><p>After the <a href=\"/u-foes/4060-3238/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3238\"> U-Foes</a> attack on <a href=\"/volstagg/4005-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3513\"> Volstagg</a> at Soldier Field, <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Osborn</a> declared his <a href=\"/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\"> Siege</a> on <a href=\"/asgard/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\"> Asgard</a>.

Ares reluctantly agrees to help but assures Osborn that if he is lying he will cut off his head, armor and all.</p><p>Ares rallies the H.A.M.M.E.R. troops before battle with a war cry and the Siege begins.

His physical capabilities are superior to those of the majority of Olympian gods. He has virtually inexhaustible stamina, and does not tire appreciably after any exertion. He is stronger than the average Olympian, strength level estimated to being able to lift around 70 tons. Zeus and Hercules are the only Olympians stronger than Ares.</p><p>Like all Olympians, Ares is immortal, possessing a life essence that cannot be ended by any conventional means. He can be wounded in battle, but his godly life force gives him incredible recuperative abilities. He can fully recover from penetration wounds (such as by knife, sword, or bullet) in anywhere from minutes to hours, depending on their severity. Only an injury of such magnitude that it incinerates him or disperses a major portion of his bodily molecules could cause him physical death. Even then, his life essence may still be unharmed, and Zeus may be able to resurrect him.</p><p>Superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Ares also possesses a regenerative healing factor which is capable of repairing damaged or destroyed tissue at superhuman levels of speed. He has also been shown to be injured by weapons of magical nature such as Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor. He also has some low-level magic abilities such as summoning weapons or sensing if magic is being used.</p><h3>Abilities</h3><p>Ares is the god of war and is a master of a variety of hand-to-hand combat skills. Ares is also a master of all Olympian weaponry and most human weapons ranging from clubs to modern firearms and explosives. Though having normal intellect Ares' military tactical skills are at genius-level, and he is also well versed in torture, combat engineering, and knows vast amount of military history particularly focusing on battles and wars that involved Greek and Roman (or Italian) soldiers and armies. Ares is one of the most talented and ruthless soldiers that has ever fought on Earth.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77137\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.8875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77137\"><img alt=\"Ares armed with guns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ares armed with guns\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/124/77137-21903-ares.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ares armed with guns</figcaption></figure><p>Ares uses a variety of weapons which includes ancient Greek and Roman javelins, axes, swords, knives, shields, spears, and flails.

Shortly afterward, Heather sacrificed her life to protect Daniel from a wolf pack, and her spirit ascended to Feng-Tu. The denizens of K'un-Lun found Daniel and took him in, while a frostbite-crippled Meachum learned of Daniel's survival and spent the next decade preparing elaborate defenses against future attack.</p><p>Vowing to avenge his parents, Daniel Rand studied martial arts under Lei Kung the Thunderer, while growing up in K'un-Lun. His closest friends were Miranda Rand-K'ai, whom he did not know was his half-sister, and a K'un-Lun boy named <a href=\"/sharyd/4005-23382/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23382\"> Conal D'hu-Tsien</a>. At nineteen, requested and earned an opportunity to win the power of the Iron Fist by confronting Shou-Lao the Undying, whose power resided within a flaming brazier. slew Shou-Lao, a feat no other warrior had ever accomplished, by pressing his chest to the dragon's, cutting it off from the life energy it absorbed from it's heart, which resided in a nearby brazier. This resulted in a dragon-shaped brand on his chest. He then plunged his hands into the brazier containing the dragon's heart, and gained the power of the Iron Fist.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Iron Fist was created by <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\"> Roy Thomas</a> and <a href=\"/gil-kane/4040-1764/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1764\"> Gil Kane</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/marvel-premiere-the-fury-of-iron-fist/4000-47481/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-47481\"> Marvel Premiere #15</a> (1974).

Shortly afterward, fought off jealous peers with the aid of Conal and Miranda, whom Conal had taught martial arts in defiance of K'un-Lun law. Fleeing K'un-Lun, Miranda and Conal were captured by K'un-Lun's ancestral enemies, the plant-beings called the <a href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=H%27lythri&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"> H'lythri</a><u>,</u> and presumed dead. The dimensional nexus opened on schedule, and, as Iron Fist, traveled to, seeking vengeance on Meachum. Meachum knew of Danny's return and placed a bounty of ten thousand dollars on his head. The open contract left open to attacks from other costumed menaces such as the man called <a href=\"../../scythe/29-21215/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Scythe</a>. Iron Fist eventually overcame Meachum's defenses, but on seeing Meachum was an invalid, he spared the broken man.</p><p>Meachum was instead slain by the ghostly Ninja, a servant of Master Khan. Blamed for the murder, Iron Fist eventually cleared himself with the help of two private detectives he befriended, samurai-trained <a href=\"../../colleen-wing/29-1494/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Colleen Wing</a> and cyborg ex-cop <a href=\"../../misty-knight/29-1491/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Misty Knight</a>. Nonetheless, Iron Fist often had hostile relations with his new business partners, Meachum's brother, <a href=\"/ward-meachum/4005-28163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28163\"> Ward</a>, and daughter, <a href=\"/joy-meachum/4005-23380/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23380\"> Joy</a>. Iron Fist's adventures continued against the likes of the <a href=\"../../wikid/kara-kai-death-cult/29-36164/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cult of Kara-Kai</a>, worshipers of the goddess Kali; <a href=\"/warhawk/4005-27562/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27562\"> Warhawk</a> <a href=\"../../wikid/warhawk/29-27562/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> ,</a> a war veteran turned assassin empowered by a process similar to that of <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Luke Cage</a>; and the alien robot known as the <a href=\"/monstroid/4005-26192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26192\"> Monstroid</a>. In the process, he learned that the Ninja was using Colleen Wing's father, Lee, as a host; Iron Fist ended this magical possession.</p><p>Soon afterward, Iron Fist fought the Steel Serpent, a master martial artist specializing in the delayed death touch. The Serpent had twice in the past been defeated by Yu-Ti in attempts to take over K'un Lun, and he fell victim to his own power during his assault on Iron Fist. Rand then encountered a woman named <a href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=Jade_%28embodiment%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jade</a> and defended her from agents of <a href=\"../../dhasha-khan/29-35785/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Dhasha Khan</a>, a demonic warrior sorcerer who had conquered Feng-Tu; however, more of Khan's agents abducted Iron Fist and Jade, whom Iron Fist learned was the embodiment of humanity's nobility, her soul bonded with the cosmic <a href=\"/firebird/4005-3323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3323\"> Firebird</a>. Iron Fist was defeated by Khan's enslaved warrior, the Silver Dragon, while Khan used his mystic <a href=\"../../wikid/soul-gem/18-55645/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Soulgem</a> to rob Jade of the Firebird, which he used to transform Earth. Iron Fist defeated the Silver Dragon and discovered she was the spirit of his mother, Heather Rand. Iron Fist then defeated Khan in battle, using the Soulgem to restore Earth and return his mother to a peaceful afterlife. Although he had fallen in love with Jade and wished she could remain mortal, he knew that humanity needed the Firebird, and he used the Soulgem to restore Jade.</p><p>Over the next few months, Iron Fist became a noted crime fighter and clashed with enemies such as Master Khan, <a href=\"/scimitar/4005-3429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3429\"> Scimitar</a>, <a href=\"/chaka/4005-35462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35462\"> Chaka</a>, the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/4060-18519/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18519\"> Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/drom-the-backwards-man/4005-59248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59248\"> Drom, the Backwards Man</a> and <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\"> Sabretooth</a>.

Iron Fist then faced Davos, Lei Kung's banished son, who sought to steal the Iron Fist power. Also calling himself Steel Serpent, Davos briefly succeeded in usurping the power before losing it back to and being defeated by Iron Fist; his soul was imprisoned within the alien <a href=\"../../wikid/contemplator/29-13988/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Contemplator</a>'s Anomaly Gem.</p><h3>Heroes for Hire</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-344826\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6025\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-344826\"><img alt=\"Heroes for Hire\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg 399w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heroes for Hire\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire.jpg 399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heroes for Hire</figcaption></figure><p>Iron Fist became Misty Knight's lover; he defended her from Luke Cage, a super-strong mercenary blackmailed into serving Knight's enemy, <a href=\"/bushmaster/4005-30720/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30720\"> Bushmaster</a>.

While Iron Fist and the cynically down-to-earth Cage were very different, they shared a dedication to justice and became best friends. Soon, Iron Fist and Cage confronted Master Khan, whom they pursued to K'un-Lun. Reunited with Lei Kung, Iron Fist was appalled to learn that the population had been decimated by the H'ylthri, and he and Cage led K'un-Lun's remaining warriors against their foes; however, Iron Fist's time on Earth had changed him, and he became disillusioned by K'un-Lun's regimented culture. He was then captured by his adoptive uncle, Yu-Ti, who hoped to use him to appease Master Khan; however, even Khan feared the full power of the Iron Fist and was threatened into releasing his enemies. Iron Fist destroyed the mystic emerald that stabilized K'un-Lun's link to Earth, making future interfaces unpredictable, then returned to with Cage. Khan himself became trapped on Earth and was unable to prevent Chiantang from escaping and almost destroying K'un-Lun.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-344829\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-344829\"><img alt=\"Iron Fist dead?!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Fist dead?!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Fist dead?!</figcaption></figure><p>Khan later enlisted <a href=\"/ward-meachum/4005-28163/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28163\">Ward Meachum</a>, Cage's enemies <a href=\"../../wikid/shades/29-11015/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Shades</a> and <a href=\"/comanche/4005-34965/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34965\"> Comanche</a>, and <a href=\"../../wikid/ferocia/29-42051/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Fera</a> in a plot against Iron Fist; Fera was actually one of the wolves who had slain Heather Rand, granted human form via the magical power of Shirrair and enslaved by Master Khan.

Meanwhile, Khan himself usurped the form of police officer Tyrone King and began romancing Misty Knight to undermine his enemy.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Iron Fist was exposed to deadly radiation and, accompanied by Cage and Wing, he returned to K'un-Lun. Instructed in the use of his healing power by Lei Kung, Iron Fist learned that Chiantang's attack had been in response to Shou-Lao's death and became overwhelmed with guilt, but recovered with the help of his friends, who banished Chiantang. Preparing to return to Earth, Iron Fist was secretly ambushed by the H'ylthri, who sent a duplicate, believing itself to be Iron Fist, in his place. As for Chiantang, he too appeared on Earth, where Khan, as Tyrone King, slew him; however, even Khan was unaware of the H'ylthri's substitution. Shortly afterward, the Iron Fist duplicate attempted to heal \"Bobby Wright\", who was supposedly dying; the attempt seemed successful, but \"Wright\" suffered a relapse and, as Captain Hero, beat the duplicate to death in a rage. Khan, believing his enemy dead, then dismissed the Super-Skrull and eventually abandoned his King identity, leaving Cage to take the blame for the death of \"Iron Fist\".</p><h3>Resurrection</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/591015-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-591015\" data-ratio=\"1.5320945945946\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/591015-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-591015\"><img alt=\"Iron Fist helps Namor regain his memory, while Dr. Doom presides. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/591015-5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/229/591015-5.jpg 592w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/229/591015-5.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/591015-5.jpg 417w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Fist helps Namor regain his memory, while Dr. Doom presides. \" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/591015-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/229/591015-5.jpg 592w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/229/591015-5.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/229/591015-5.jpg 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Fist helps Namor regain his memory, while Dr. Doom presides. </figcaption></figure><p>For months, the true Iron Fist remained the H'ylthri's captive. While in stasis he manages to focus his chi, curing the cancer. But when the Super-Skrull impersonated Iron Fist himself, Knight and Wing learned that the \"Iron Fist\" they had buried had reverted to plant-like remains. Following the Super-Skrull's defeat by <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\"> Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>, Knight and Wing brought Namor to K'un-Lun, where they rescued Iron Fist. Soon afterward, Iron Fist helped Cage defeat Bushmaster again. But, while Cage was pleased to see his friend alive, he was uninterested in re-forming Heroes for Hire. When Master Khan vengefully rendered Namor amnesiac, Iron Fist helped Knight along with Namor's friends and family in locating the now-savage Namor. They were able to restore his memory and confronted Khan, who was apparently slain by Namor.</p><p>Iron Fist went on to aid other heroes against threats such as the mystic <a href=\"/legion-of-vengeance/4060-56638/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56638\"> Legion of Vengeance</a>, the feral mutant Sabretooth, and the forces of the mutated serial killer <a href=\"../../wikid/carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Carnage</a>.

Weeks later, Iron Fist was manipulated into stealing the powerful <a href=\"/zodiac-key/4055-51532/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-51532\"> Zodiac Key</a> by Death Sting, actually Miranda Rand-K'ai, who, along with Conal, had been pressed into H'ylthri service. Iron Fist fought the pair and their H'ylthri masters, and both Death Sting and Conal were believed slain, although Death Sting survived.</p><p>Meanwhile, the heroes supposedly slain by Onslaught had returned, and Iron Fist, belatedly realizing that humanity would reject rule by K'un-Lun, sought to stop the process he had begun; but young Hand assassin <a href=\"/junzo-muto/4005-21192/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21192\"> Junzo Muto</a> stole his power in order to bring K'un-Lun to . Heather Rand's spirit told Iron Fist that Muto could not succeed without him, leaving K'un-Lun to move on to an unknown fate. Unwilling to risk K'un-Lun's destruction, Iron Fist teamed with <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\"> Wolverine</a>, Yu-Ti and others to defeat Muto, but not before K'un-Lun began to merge with the city of. Yu-Ti then stabbed Iron Fist, reasoning that his death would separate the cities. K'un-Lun indeed returned to its proper place, but Iron Fist was met in Feng-Tu by his proud parents, who restored him to life.</p><p>Back in New York , former Heroes for Hire foe Nightshade resurrected Chiantang to use him against her current enemy, the <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\"> Black Panther</a>. Chiantang turned on her, re-empowered Iron Fist, and mentally enslaved him to fight the Panther, but Iron Fist regained his senses and helped defeat Chiantang. Returning to crime fighting, he found it unsatisfying and left to seek a new path. Yet all paths, it seemed, led back to K'un-Lun, for he soon faced Chi, a sorcerer exiled from K'un-Lun a millennium before, who hoped to use Iron Fist's unique bond to K'un-Lun for conquest. Iron Fist defeated Chi, accepting his heroic role anew.</p><h3>Civil War &amp; Daredevil</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190697\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.41\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190697\"><img alt=\"Rand as Daredevil.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rand as Daredevil.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rand as Daredevil.</figcaption></figure><p>When Matt Murdock was exposed as <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Daredevil</a> and put in jail, Danny was hired to dress and act as Daredevil to create the illusion that he and Murdock were two separate people.

He tells them Nul is being drawn to the Concordance Engine, and that when he breaks it, he will break the world -- a world John thinks needs breaking because it is \"violent, loveless, [and] entirely mad.\" Prester John plans to bring his faithful aboard an ark: a spaceship that will carry them to a new home in the new universe. The Concordance Engine, a shining arrangement of pipes that seems to make everything around it less real, is located deep beneath Wundagore Mountain and guarded by a silent, masked knight whom Prester John calls brother. As the Defenders stand before it, Nul arrives and begins to fight his way into New Avalon.</p><p>As Nul rampages through New Avalon's upper levels, Prester John releases the Silver Surfer. He tells the Defenders they must choose between going with him into the new universe or remaining behind to witness the end of the old one. The Surfer is dismayed at being laid low by a mere man and says they must destroy Nul <i>and</i> prevent Prester John from leaving the universe: a tall order. The Defenders feel sickened by the proximity of Nul, but it doesn't stop the Red She-Hulk from sprinting into battle.</p><p>The Surfer, realizing that Prester John's ship will destroy the universe just by firing its engines, leaves the Engine and his teammates to stop it. He has leads Prester John's ship away from Earth, infused it with the Power Cosmic, and set it on an unchangeable course into space, presumably for centuries, carrying John and his hapless New Men with it.</p><p>The Defenders have moved the Concordance Engine from its place under Mt.

Inside is the body of a giant, with a submersible ship embedded in its chest. Among the ship's treasures is a second Concordance Engine. In Danny's Harlem apartment, he is attempting to reconnect with Misty Knight over a candlelit dinner when Fat Cobra staggers in, near death, and exclaims, \"He's killing us all.. and it's your fault!\"</p><p>Danny uses the Iron Fist to save his life. Unfortunately, a quick survey by Danny reveals that the Immortal Weapons are indeed being murdered. With the aid of the Silver Surfer, Danny searches his own library for references to the Concordance Engines. They find a series of accounts written by Ernst Erskine, one of Wendell Rand's teammates with a group called the Confederates of the Curious. John Aman, the Prince of Orphans, arrives. He is dead-convinced of two things: that Danny and \"his gang\" are going to shut the Engines down and that he must be killed. Iron Fist tries to ask whether Aman murdered the other Immortal Weapons by mistake, but cannot get a clear answer before the Silver Surfer intervenes, inhaling Prince of Orphans' mist form and carries him off, depositing him in the caldera of an active volcano. Danny calls his attention to another passage in his book of the Confederates of the Curious. They found an Engine in Z'Gambo, guarded by John Aman, Captain Nemo, Leonard McKenzie, Princess Fen, and others; moreover, they also found evidence of more Engines all over the world. Danny resolves to shut the Engines down.</p><p>The Defenders arrive in the neighboring state of Wakanda to meet with T'Challa and his sister Princess Shuri. Iron Fist is eager to pursue the connection between Z'Gambo, the Concordance Engines, and Prince of Orphans -- an Immortal Weapon who may have been killing the others to protect an Engine. T'Challa and Shuri inform them that Wakanda and Z'Gambo have a ceasefire agreement because of a long and painful history of war between the two nations, and that no one crosses the border from one to the other. As soon as T'Challa mentions John Aman's name, the man himself appears and attacks him with poisonous mist. Doctor Strange struggles to save his life, while T'Challa tells Shuri to avenge him. Shuri says that Z'Gambo and Wakanda are now at war.</p><p>Black Cat infiltrates Z'Gambo, to steal the Brass Frog, but is caught almost instantly by John Aman, the Prince of Orphans. As he is about to take her life, he senses the approach of the Defenders, arriving from Wakanda in a desperate bid to neutralize Aman and prevent the two micro-nations from going to war. Aman releases Black Cat and heads off to deal with them. The Defenders, particularly Iron Fist, are alarmed to see that Z'Gambo is nothing but bones. Aman appears and confronts them. Cursing the Defenders for their ignorance, Aman holds off their attacks with ease. Black Cat intervenes to rescue Doctor Strange, but she quickly falls as Aman uses a poisonous attack intended to murder them all. Silver Surfer, who does not need to breathe, is immune, and he fires a cosmic blast which temporarily incapacitates Aman.</p><p>The Defenders meet the Council of Antiquarians in their airship and compare notes. The Council has apparently taken possession of all of Aman's treasures, though the man himself (contained in a purple bubble) will be sent to Wakanda as a prisoner. The three Brass Frogs, united, reveal the power of a Concordance Engine. Aman, seeing it, smiles and remembers his time with a special band of nine people who devoted their lives to protecting the Engines. Once, on the run from a Death Celestial, he hid an Engine in the form of three Frogs, modeled after those in a terrarium he used to enjoy on Captain Nemo's ship.

He later finds a matching red-haired girl named Fongji in the streets of K'un-L'un and has her trained as the Iron Fist. In the present, as Lei Kung reads this account, Nu-An tells him that that those records have been sealed until the Phoenix returns and now he must teach Iron Fist what to do. In the past, Nu-An asks for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_Leonardo_da_Vinci#Comics_and_graphic_novels\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Leonardo da Vinci</a> to come to K'un-L'un in order to help protecting the world against the Phoenix's arrival; meanwhile, <a href=\"/fongji/4005-83693/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83693\"> Fongji</a> is submitted to a hard training, eventually manifesting the Phoenix powers. Nu-An orders her to battle the dragon Shao-Lao as established by the ritual of the Iron Fist. Fongji is successful in her test and becomes the Iron Fist, shortly before Da Vinci sees the Phoenix coming towards Earth. Fongji is able to bond with the Phoenix and remain in control of herself, but she feels that Earth is still not ready for its evolution and departs. In the present time, Iron Fist tells Fongji's story to Hope and she is taken to the current Yu-Ti (whose visions indicate that she must be trained by Spider-Man). Spider-Man teaches Hope that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\" and makes her reflect about this as the potential Phoenix host.</p><h3><ins>All-New, All-Different</ins></h3><p>After former member from Heroes for Hire Jennifer Royce turned evil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist teamed up and returned to fighting crime.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77266\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-77266\"><img alt=\"Master of the Martial Arts.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master of the Martial Arts.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/77266-150505-iron-fist.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Master of the Martial Arts.</figcaption></figure><p>The Iron Fist is trained to be a \"Living Weapon\" making them one of the best martial artists in the world. They have mastered all of K'un-Lun's martial arts and many of those from Earth and has also trained in the use of all martial arts weapons and they possess the power to harness the mystical spiritual energy, or chi of Shou-Lao the Undying.</p><p><b>Chi Augmentation:</b> Plunging his fists into the molten heart of Shou-Lao the Undying gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to focus his chi and enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. Through concentration, Iron Fist can harness his spiritual energy, or chi, to augment his physical and mental capabilities to even superhuman levels. Recently his powers, skill, and awareness have been all augmented to vastly higher levels; while the extent is unknown, it was stated his sense of self has grown ten thousand fold and his capabilities now posses infinite depth. He no longer tires from using his chi and is capable of using his powers for greater tasks. Examples include destroying a train with the iron fist punch as it collided with his attack at full speed, healing himself from several external injuries, and detoxifying unwittingly ingested poison in his body with his chi.</p><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Strength:</b></i> Typically, Iron Fist possesses the pinnacle physical strength of a human man of his particular age, height, and build that engages in intense regular exercise. He possesses the peak level of strength a human can reach without being considered superhuman. With the use of his spiritual energy, Iron Fist is capable of augmenting his strength to incredible superhuman levels which limits are unknown but he was able to go toe to toe with a being who easily manhandled the likes of Luke Cage, and bring down and break off a foot of a monster hundreds of feet tall with one strike.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Speed:</b></i> Iron Fist is capable of running and moving at speeds greater than even the finest human athlete and is naturally as fast as a human can be without being considered superhuman. Iron Fist can use his spiritual energy to augment his speed to incredible superhuman levels which limits are unknown. He was able to hit a large monster over a hundred feet tall, nearly a hundred times, in the span of a few seconds at speeds faster than the human eye can track/see, move faster than a bullet and so on.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Stamina:</b></i> Iron Fist's musculature is enhanced to generate less fatigue toxins than the musculature of normal humans. He can exert himself physically at peak capacity for over an hour before fatigue begins to impair him.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Agility:</b></i> Iron Fist's natural agility, balance, and bodily coordination are superior to those of any Olympic athlete that has ever competed, and is agile as it is humanly possible.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Reflexes:</b></i> Iron Fist's reaction time is superior to that of any Olympic athlete that has ever competed, and are enhanced to the point where they could be considered superhuman. His reflexes are so efficient that he can dodge point blank gun fire, catch arrows in mid flight, and has even been capable of snatching and tagging bullets out of the air etc.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Peak Human Durability:</b></i> The tissues of Iron Fist's body are harder than those of humans. While still vulnerable to physical injury, Daniel is able to use his spiritual energy to augment his durability to vast superhuman levels. He was able to strike a train carrying \"enough raw explosives to make the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima look like nothing more than a sparkler,\" and survive the explosion at point blank range, without any sign of harm.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Chi Enhanced Healing:</b></i> If he sustains injury or illness, Iron Fist can focus his chi for the purposes of healing his injuries. On the brink of death after a battle with Radion the Atomic Man, Daniel received a vision of Yu-Ti revealing that \"the Iron Fist is not a weapon but a force of will which could perform miracles including <i>healing</i>,\" saving his life. By focusing enough he can even purge his own body of poison, however Daniel experienced great pain in the process. Recently he has proven capable of healing himself almost unconsciously and does not feel drained in the slightest. He is also capable of channeling this energy into other people, allowing them to heal with more efficiency as well.</p></li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1877656\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png\" data-ratio=\"0.83877551020408\" data-width=\"490\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 490px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1877656\"><img alt=\"Iron Fist punches through a Helicopter!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 490w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Fist punches through a Helicopter!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 490w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/10/100123/1877656-ironfist.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Fist punches through a Helicopter!</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p><i><b>Iron Fist Punch:</b></i> By summoning his chi and focusing it into his hand, he can draw upon the superhuman energy derived from the heart of the mystic serpent Shou-Lao and make his fist inhumanly powerful and super humanly resistant to injury and pain on a very high superhuman level. This \"iron fist\" technique does not involve a physical transformation of any kind, simply a psychic channeling of concentrated natural energy. With his fist in this state, Iron Fist can shatter wood and brick, rip through steel, and punch his opponents with extraordinary concussive force without sustaining injury to himself. He can hit with such vast force that he has knocked out incredibly durable Super humans such as the likes of Colossus with his Iron Fist, shatter <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\"> Scorpion</a>'s tail, destroy <a href=\"/thunderball/4005-2253/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2253\"> Thunderball</a>'s wrecking ball weapon, smash through jets, mechs, and in extreme cases, he has brought down the <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\"> Hammer</a> <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\"> Helicarrier</a> with one strike, The act of summoning and using his chi for the Iron Fist technique used to mentally drains him after long periods of use but no more.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Mind Meld:</b></i> Iron Fist can use his power to temporarily fuse his consciousness with another person, resulting in a sharing of knowledge, emotions, and memories.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Energy Absorption:</b></i> At times, he has absorbed energy directed at himself and channeled it to augment his own power.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Energy Manipulation:</b></i> Learned how to tap into energy fields, most notable the electromagnetic field</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Heightened Awareness:</b></i> Recently his awareness has increased to new levels. To what level it is unclear. His senses are so great he can hear the sweat running down the cheek of a person in another room, and even with his back turned he is able to sense when a complete stranger (The Iron Fist Killer.) is going to strike before they actually do. <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Daniel_Rand_%28Earth-616%29#cite_note-Immortal_Iron_Fist_Vol_1_17-5\" rel=\"nofollow\"> [6]</a>.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Enhanced Sight:</b></i> He has unusually keen eyesight, but it is unclear if it extends to superhuman level.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><i><b>Environmental Adaptation:</b></i> His entire body is oriented to combat, enabling him to adapt to any environment with minimal exposure.</p></li></ul><p><b>Chi Manipulation:</b> The Iron Fist grants Danny with many abilities that he has possibly not yet learned, such as channeling the Shou-Lao chi into a ranged weapon, such as a gun or bow, to increase its striking capabilities; this technique is used both by Orson Randall and Wu Ao-Shi. Also another ability demonstrated by Orson Randall is hypnosis, Danny has mastered this ability according to himself after being shown it.

He's first introduced in the midst of a misunderstanding involving a shoplifter, which causes Danny to get punched out by Spider-Man and arrested by the police. He is eventually released from prison some months later, and meets up with his old buddy Shang-Chi in Chinatown. After Shang-Chi is attacked by <a href=\"/hammerhead/4005-6817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6817\">Hammerhead </a> and his thugs, the two martial artists decide to take down the gangster and his organization.

Danny confesses to being the traitor, and reveals that he has a daughter with a woman named Colleen (implied to be the Ultimate version of Colleen Wing).

Raised in a traumatizing world of the European streets, Johann’s mind found itself warped and paved for something much more sinister to come. Born in a village within <a href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\"> Germany</a>, Johann's life would start its dark path when his mother would die from giving birth to him. This event drove Johann’s drunken father in a depressing state to where he would cope with the idea of avenging his stressful problems by simply drowning the infant Johann. Saved from near death by the delivering doctor after halting Johann’s father from killing him, Johann’s father would later commit suicide that would force Johann without any parents and to be forced into an orphanage. Growing up into a life of being bullied, Johann’s hatred for others slowly began to expand itself by being convinced that every man was truly his enemy. Hating every passing day of abuse, Johann predictably ran away to led on a life as a beggar and a petty thief. Usually taking menial jobs to keep himself sustained, Johann later found himself offered a job as a sweeper for a Jewish shopkeeper and also found friendship with the daughter of the shop owner as well. As the girl took a liking towards Johann, it would be when he forced himself onto her where she would deny him because of his actions. Johann would finally take his inner feelings into action by committing his first murder when he killed the girl in a fit of blind rage with a shovel.</p><p>Back out on the streets again and desperate for any means for survival, Johann would have his chance in 1933 after being one of the many Germans who were forced into joining the Nazi Party as a Sturmabteilung. As Hitler rose to power, Johann still wasn’t satisfied seeing how he was merely a prop rather than a fighter like the S.S. But Johann’s life would change after learning that Hitler was staying within a selected hotel, Johann secretly came up with the idea of making an impression on Hitler by acting out as one of the hotels bellboys. Upon learning that <a href=\"/adolf-hitler/4005-9671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9671\"> Adolf Hitler</a> was making his stay, Johann successfully acted as one of the hotels bellboy’s who tended to the Fuhrers stay. Coming upon Hitler scolding one of his Gestapo’s for failure of capturing a spy who recently escaped from Germany, Hitler took notice of Johann claiming that he personally could teach Johann to be a better Nazi than any of his own officers. At first glance during Hitlers claim, Hitler not only found a potential recruit within Johann, but something that even the ruler of Germany would fear himself. Ever dedicated to prove himself to be what the Fuhrer of Germany saw within him, Johann proudly accepted his training as an S.S. Officer.</p><p>After Hitler later found himself unimpressed with Johann’s training, the Fuhrer relieved Johann's commanding officer and strictly took over Johann’s training himself. Shaped and molded into Hitlers own twisted image before his training was finished, Johann became the second most powerful man within Germany who answered to no one but Hitler himself. As his first act under Hitlers command, Johann killed his former officer who failed to train him under Hitler’s ideal for an S.S Officer. This twisted accomplishment awarded Johann an officer uniform, rank, and a trademark that would be burnt into the hearts of those who would dare oppose Hitler’s agenda, Johann was given a blood red mask of a skull that would be worn and show his enemies Hitler’s wrath and image that would install fear. Thus the Red Skull was born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/380863-163266-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380863\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/380863-163266-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-380863\"><img alt=\"Red Skull would be known as Marvel Comics first super-villain that led a long and enduring career as a major threat within the Marvel Universe\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/380863-163266-red-skull.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/380863-163266-red-skull.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Red Skull would be known as Marvel Comics first super-villain that led a long and enduring career as a major threat within the Marvel Universe</figcaption></figure><p>When Marvel Comics was introduced in 1939, there truly wasn’t any official superhero or villain until World War II first began. As a response to the war propaganda, editor <a href=\"/joe-simon/4040-9443/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9443\"> Joe Simon</a>, <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\"> Jack Kirby</a>, and scripter <a href=\"/ed-herron/4040-48364/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-48364\"> Ed Herron</a> not only introduced their very first official superhero <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America</a>, but also introduced the very first super-villain within <a href=\"/marvel-comics/4050-18577/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18577\"> Marvel Comics</a> known as the Red Skull. Completely the opposite of Captain America and everything the hero represented, Marvel Comics would display the Red Skull as a villain who strongly resembled oppression and totalitarianism. Wearing a horrific Blood-red death’s-head mask, Marvel Comics would find themselves creating the ultimate villain. Even though <em>Captain America Comics #1</em> was meant to be Red Skull’s first and last appearance, the growing fan base later had Red Skull reintroduced in <em><a href=\"/captain-america-comics-the-red-skull/4000-117551/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-117551\">Captain America Comics Issue #7</a></em>.</p><p>This caused the true Red Skull’s (Johann Schmidt) first official appearance to be in <em>Captain America Comics #7</em>, stating that the original Red Skull was an imposter who was secretly working with the Red Skull. As the war was coming to an end, so was the era of superheroes due to their strong relationship with the war. Both Captain America and Red Skull would find their supposed last appearance in October 1949 within <em>Captain America Weird Tales #74</em>, where both men found themselves battling each other within the depths of hell.</p><p>Red Skull’s name wouldn’t be mentioned until 1953 in <em><a href=\"/young-men/4050-1368/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1368\"> <i>Young Men</i></a> #24</em>. Having Red Skull displayed much more differently as a communist mastermind, but both Red Skull and the returned Captain America found themselves unsuccessful with the fan base and Marvel Comics later disregarding both comebacks of Captain America and Red Skull. It would be years later after editor Stan Lee properly introduced Red Skull who was still holding his Nazi identity, later identified this 50’s version of the Red Skull as the Russian spy known as <a href=\"/red-skull-malik/4005-77248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77248\"> Albert Malik</a>.</p><p>It wouldn’t be until July 1966 when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby would properly revive Red Skull into Marvel Comics within <em><a href=\"/tales-of-suspense/4050-2007/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2007\"> <i>Tales of Suspense</i></a> #79</em>. Giving more character into the Red Skull with a detailed origin and the cause of his disappearance, Stan Lee would ultimately ignore Red Skull’s demise in <em>Captain America Weird Tales #74</em> and revival within <em>Young Men #24</em>, properly set a new pace for Red Skulls career within Marvel Comics as criminal mastermind that constantly threatened Captain America and the Marvel Universe several times.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>The Golden Age</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\"> Golden Age</a> of Marvel Comics, Red Skull was known to be one of the most feared villains who served underneath the command of Hitler himself. As his terror was spreading across Europe, Red Skull’s reign would come to a halt when the United States presented their own special weapon, the super soldier known as <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America</a>. Throughout WWII, both Captain America and Red Skull found themselves constantly battling and Red Skull would also find himself fighting the other costumed mystery men who opposed the <a href=\"/third-reich/4060-49867/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\"> Third Reich</a>.</p><p>However, as WWII was coming to an end, both Captain America and Red Skull found themselves coming to an end as well. With both men believed to be dead, both Red Skull and Captain America later revived in the early 50’s only to later disappear under unknown circumstances. It would later be revealed that the recent Red Skull wasn’t the original, but a communist known as <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\"> Albert Malik</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\"> The Silver Age</a></h3><p>After Captain America’s body been found and revived, the hero would later find himself followed by the resurrected Red Skull as well. Despite the fact that Red Skull no longer held an army of his own, he was still far more of a dangerous threat from vast amount of equipment, weaponry, robots, and various locations that he personally owned during WWII. Far more dangerous than before, Red Skull found his revival as a better chance of doing what Hitler failed to do himself, which was world domination. Several times Red Skull has either made an attempt to rule the world or by killing off Captain America in the most elaborate and carefully planned schemes.</p><h3><a href=\"/bronze-age/4015-55978/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55978\"> The Bronze Age</a></h3><p>Throughout the Silver and Bronze Age, Red Skull has crossed paths of other well-known villains within the Marvel Universe. Tricking and using the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\"> Kingpin of Crime</a> in a plan to rid Captain America and ran across <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Dr Doom</a> twice when trying to take over <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\"> Latveria</a>. One scheme found itself backfiring against the Red Skull when he gave <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\"> Sam Wilson</a> powers so that he could secretly attack Captain America, only to find Sam taking up the costumed role as the Falcon and becoming Captain America’s longtime partner.</p><p>At the very end of the Bronze Age within comics, Red Skull found himself dying once more and making a final attempt to end both Captain America and himself at the same time. However this plan almost successful as the Red Skull would die from a stroke in the arms of his most hated enemy.</p><h3>The Modern Age</h3><p>Red Skull would make his debut within the Modern Age much more differently than before. Revived in a clone body of Captain America, Red Skull decided to keep his status low and accomplish his same two goals differently through means of business and politics rather than frontal terrorist attacks. Red Skull has found himself more successful than his prior attacks against Captain America and his enemies because of his reach across the Marvel Universe that could easily grant him access to just about anything he truly wanted.</p><h3><a href=\"/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/4045-54540/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-54540\"> Death of Captain America</a></h3><p>After the events of <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a> and <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\"> Bucky’s</a> return, Red Skull would find himself partaking in a scheme of killing Captain America. Even though Red Skull successfully orchestrated Captain America’s death, he would later be defeated once more when Bucky took the role of Captain America and foiled Red Skull’s plans of being fully revived in his own body once more.</p><h3><a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\"> Dark Reign</a></h3><p>With <a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\"> Norman Osborn’s Dark Reign</a> coming to an end, Red Skull would make his appearance when accepting Osborn’s idea of him becoming the new and revived Captain America. Even though Red Skull did manage to have his conscious placed in Captain America’s revived body, he would find himself defeated in a conscious battle with Captain America and physically defeated by both Captain America and the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a> as well.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Terror of the Red Skull</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1222884\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1222884\"><img alt=\"After Captain America's creation, it was bound that both Red Skull and Captain America would meet in their climatic battle that would only set a long and enduring battle between both men.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"After Captain America's creation, it was bound that both Red Skull and Captain America would meet in their climatic battle that would only set a long and enduring battle between both men.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/36386/1222884-872908_cap_600_wallpaper_by_mbreitweiser.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>After Captain America's creation, it was bound that both Red Skull and Captain America would meet in their climatic battle that would only set a long and enduring battle between both men.</figcaption></figure><p>As the Red Skull quickly became a name of sheer intimidation under Hitler’s guidance. The image of the Red Skull would perfectly be burnt into the minds of those who have fallen under the Red Skull’s path of destruction. Red Skull later took his skills within the fields of espionage and sabotage and quickly became recognized as a master-of-disguise due to his success. Aside from his personal experiences, Red Skull successfully lead armies of Nazi troops on several violent campaigns that claimed numerous European countries and villages under Hitler's name. Leaving a path of carnage and pure destruction also found itself reaching the ocean waters when Red Skull also became a terror throughout the seas as he guided Naval assaults through several attacks against enemy ships. By the time Red Skull had both European land and sea in Hitlers control, he took the opportunity to install operations within other countries and even within America before the country became involved with the war, an act that later found himself being rewarded as a headmaster of the S.S. recruiting. Even though Red Skull was a single force, he would later encounter allies who would also find themselves becoming a major asset with Hitler's rise. Allies like <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\"> Baron Wolfgang Strucker</a> who was the leader of the Death’s Head Squadron, the deformed biochemist known as <a href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\"> Arnim Zola</a>, and Nazi’s top scientist <a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\"> Dr Baron Hienrich Zemo</a>. It’s also known that sometime within this time frame, Red Skull would recognize <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\"> Sgt Nick Fury’s</a> Howling Commandos successful attacks against the Nazi army and Baron Zemo and responded to Fury's potential threat by creating a similar group of his own known as the <a href=\"/exiles/4060-56383/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56383\"> Exiles</a>. But there was one man that Red Skull encountered who was a valuable scientist who was secretly against Hitler’s agenda and idea’s of creating Nazi super soldiers, and became the man who would be responsible for America's response for the Red Skull.</p><p><a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\"> Abraham Erskine</a> was one of the few who were against Hitler and his plans for Erskine. A scientist who managed to perfect a formula that could create a super-soldier army, Erskine managed to flee Germany and seek refuge in America to help the U.S defeat Hitler’s reign of terror and the Red Skull. Upon learning of this escape, Red Skull was desperate to reach Hitler’s goals of obtaining the secrets of the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\"> Super Soldier Serum</a>, this desperate attempt found just about all friends, co-workers, and employees who knew Erskine to be interrogate that resulted with violent torture and ending with death. As the American government realized that their forces may not be enough to take down Hitler’s right hand man, with Erskine's help, they responded with an attempt to create an army of american super-soldiers and went about doing this by using their first test subject, the frail, but willing Steve Rogers. With experiment on Roger proving successful, Erskine was instantly killed by Nazi spies who halted the governments attempt for their super-soldier army. Yet, with only one super-soldier, Rogers was out-fitted with a unique uniform and shield, taking the title as the symbol of America known as Captain America. As Captain America entered the <a href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\"> German</a> occupied <a href=\"/paris/4020-56052/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56052\"> Paris</a>, the hero successfully guided an army of U.S soldiers to take on Red Skulls forces which led to both men finally facing each other one on one. To Red Skull’s surprise, Captain America not only led a victory against Red Skull’s forces, but also single handily defeated the Red Skull in combat as well.</p><h3>An enemy among WWII</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1231646\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4220532319392\" data-width=\"526\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 526px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1231646\"><img alt=\"Even though Red Skull fought other heroes throughout World War II, none could ever reach the hatred that he has for Captain America.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-width=\"675\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg 526w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Even though Red Skull fought other heroes throughout World War II, none could ever reach the hatred that he has for Captain America.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1231646-15_cappaper3_02.jpg 526w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" data-width=\"675\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even though Red Skull fought other heroes throughout World War II, none could ever reach the hatred that he has for Captain America.</figcaption></figure><p>Tasting defeat for the first time, Red Skull was hit hard with grief for his failure to defeat his heroic counter-part. Seeing himself as a man who failed Hitler’s teachings and viewed as a man who should be feared, Red Skull would consider on committing suicide. But realizing that his feelings and hatred were not of Hitler’s own ideas and that Red Skull was only driven for his personal hatred for humanity, he decided to focus on gaining revenge against his new threat that eventually led both himself and Captain America to become sworn enemies throughout WWII. In 1941, Red Skull decided to attack his nemesis behind the scenes while he would convince Captain America that he is in fact battling the real Red Skull. Recruiting one of his agents <a href=\"/red-skull-maxon/4005-77247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77247\"> George Maxon</a> who was a spy within America, Maxon would take the disguise of the Red Skull and went about carrying missions that would involve Captain America and his sidekick Bucky. Hoping that Maxon would successfully defeat both of these heroes, Maxon would find himself dying when going against the heroes.</p><p>If there was one thing about Red Skull's relation towards Hitler, was that Hitler took great pride with his creation to where he practically gave Red Skull anything that he wanted, despite his failures on defeating Captain America. Financing and constructing bases all around the world (possibly one of these bases given to his team the Exiles), equipment and weaponry with highly advanced technology created by Nazi scientists. Just about anything that Red Skull could possibly obtain to help him on his cause for warfare, the destruction of his nemesis Captain America, and all other costumed forces who opposed the Red Skull. Battling heroes such as the <a href=\"/young-allies/4060-40515/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40515\"> Young Allies</a> which was formed by Captain America’s sidekick Bucky, the <a href=\"/invaders/4060-25865/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25865\"> Invaders</a>, <a href=\"/liberty-legion/4060-44574/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44574\"> Liberty Legion</a>, Sgt. Nick Fury and his Howling Commandos, the <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7942/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7942\"> Destroyer</a>, <a href=\"/father-time/4005-46882/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46882\"> Father Time</a>, and <a href=\"/jack-frost/4005-35727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35727\"> Jack Frost</a> from Liberty Legion. But among all other enemies that Red Skull obtained throughout World War II, there was none that could reach the level of hatred that Red Skull had for Captain America. Red Skull would also find himself gaining new allies such as the mad cyborg scientist named <a href=\"/brain-drain/4005-26486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26486\"> Brain Drain</a>, <a href=\"/warrior-woman/4005-28406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28406\"> Warrior Woman</a>, and <a href=\"/master-man/4005-15205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15205\"> Master Man</a>. After managing to release an ancient massive robot that was quickly buried by Captain America, Red Skull would used its design to create robots himself that was called “<a href=\"/the-sleeper/4005-38806/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38806\"> sleeper</a>s” which they would lay in dormant for years as a failsafe if the Nazi’s were to face defeat within the war. In 1944, Red Skull finds himself successfully capturing the <a href=\"/ancient-one/4005-2212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2212\"> Ancient One</a> and obtaining the powerful object known as the <a href=\"/eye-of-agamotto/4055-55701/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55701\"> Eye of Agamotto</a>. This would have Red Skull travel into the <a href=\"/the-dark-dimension/4020-56164/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56164\"> Dark Dimension</a> and form an alliance with the ruler <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\"> Dormammu</a>. However, Red Skull and Dormammu found their alliance short-lived when the team effort of Captain America, Bucky, and Sgt Nick Fury and his Howling Commandos managed pursue Red Skull and foil his plans.</p><p>As Red Skull began to realize that Hitler’s reign was about to fall, the Third Reich would find itself changing their course for the worse, starting with <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\"> Baron Strucker</a>. As Hitler grew tired of Strucker's constant failures, he ordered the Red Skull to kill him when later on he did completely the opposite. Seeing an opportunity to rebuild another army of his own, he helped Strucker escape Germany with specific instructions to build and retain an army for him to command after Hitler’s downfall. As a response to this, Strucker gave the Red Skull an experimental gas that would put him in suspended animation until the war was long over and settled, giving Red Skull the open opportunity to do what Hitler failed. Later as Hitler became tense about the inevitable defeat, Red Skull would lash out at <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\"> Baron Zemo</a> when he proposed an idea to kill of Captain America and Bucky, expressing his point that only he himself was the only man who can kill Captain America. In 1945 when Germany was facing it’s last moments, Red Skull would attempt to hide within a private strongbox that found itself quickly raided by Captain America and his allies. As both men fought in a grueling match to the death, an aerial strike would halt the fight as the strongbox began to collapse. With Red Skull finding himself buried underneath the fallen rubble, Captain America barely managed to escape believing that would be the last time he would ever see the Red Skull again. When in fact he did manage to survive the collapse and was kept in suspended animation as Strucker's experimental gas found itself setting off after the strongbox collapsed. Fully buried and laying in dormant, Red Skull's name would later reappear when another would take the role as the Red Skull.</p><h3>The Other Red Skull</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-613580\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0705882352941\" data-width=\"340\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 340px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-613580\"><img alt=\"The Soviet Government would have Albert Malik capitalize the Red Skull identity, despite the hostility between communism and Nazism.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-width=\"340\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg 340w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Soviet Government would have Albert Malik capitalize the Red Skull identity, despite the hostility between communism and Nazism.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/613580-youngmen24_redskull.jpg 340w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-width=\"340\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Soviet Government would have Albert Malik capitalize the Red Skull identity, despite the hostility between communism and Nazism.</figcaption></figure><p>After the supposed death of the Red Skull, both Captain America and Bucky would meet their same supposed fates as well when attempting to stop Zemo from stealing an experimental drone plane. With Captain America frozen alive within the arctic and Bucky finding himself recovered by the Soviets, both men would also never be seen again. As the war was finally over and Hitler met his death within the hands of <a href=\"/toro/4005-11835/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11835\"> Toro</a>, the Soviet government would appoint one of their agents Albert Malik to take the role of being the Red Skull. His first assignment was to locate Hitler’s strongbox for Nazi weapon secrets that Johann Schmidt mostly used during his reign as the Red Skull. Sidetracked with other schemes to cause mayhem throughout the world, Malik would gain the attention of a new Captain America (later to be known as the <a href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\"> Grand Director</a>) and <a href=\"/jack-monroe/4005-7618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7618\"> Jack Monroe</a> who took the role of being Bucky. Much like their former counter-parts, both heroes and villain found themselves in an constant battle with each other that naturally ended with Malik being defeated. Later Malik would encounter the parents of Peter Parker (<a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a>) who were secretly U.S government spies working with Malik. Upon learning this, Malik arranged for their deaths with a plane crash and framed them for illicit defection. After the 50’s when both Captain America and Bucky were driven mad from their Super Soldier experiment, Malik would also mysteriously disappear as well.</p><h3>The Return of the Red Skull</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-339959\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.0931677018634\" data-width=\"322\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 322px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-339959\"><img alt=\"At first glance among the Cosmic Cube, Red Skull saw his oppurtunity to do what Hitler failed, which was to rule the world.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg 322w\"><noscript><img alt=\"At first glance among the Cosmic Cube, Red Skull saw his oppurtunity to do what Hitler failed, which was to rule the world.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/17809/339959-97704-red-skull.jpg 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" data-width=\"322\"></noscript></a><figcaption>At first glance among the Cosmic Cube, Red Skull saw his oppurtunity to do what Hitler failed, which was to rule the world.</figcaption></figure><p>After Captain America was accidentally recovered, he found himself joining the newly formed group of modern day superheroes known as the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\"> Avengers</a>. Remembering past events and tragedies of Red Skull and the believed death of his sidekick Bucky. It wouldn’t be later until a group known as Advance Idea Mechanics (which was a splinter group of a massive terrorist group known as Hydra) would uncover the Red Skull from his strongbox and revive him into modern time. Agreeing to form an alliance with <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\"> A.I.M</a>, the Red Skull only accepted this alliance when noticing one of the group’s creations, the reality warping <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\"> Cosmic Cube</a>. Coming up with an elaborate plan to steal the Cube, Red Skull would use means of mind control to have its keeper easily hand over the Cube to the Red Skull. Setting a place for him to retrieve the Cube, he would finally find himself confronted by his long hated enemy Captain America. As both men exchanged words, Red Skull would successfully enrage Captain America by claiming that it was he who was responsible for Bucky’s death, which it was Baron Zemo who was acting on his behalf. Attacking the Red Skull in a fit of rage, this action would backfire against Captain America when the hero was knocked unconscious by a knockout gas emitter hidden within his clothing.</p><p>With Captain America knocked out, the keeper finally handed the Cube to the Red Skull and was granted god-like powers. Battling Captain America once again after being revived, the hero found himself to be no match for the Red Skull as the Red Skull easily bested Captain America with the Cube. Simply entertaining himself by creating an artificial being to fight the Captain and even taunt the Captain by threatening to erase him from existence. However, the defeated Captain would take an advantage of Red Skulls overconfidence and separate him from the cube by a surprising attack. Believing that the Red Skull was dead once more after witnessing him chase after the fallen Cube that fell over a cliff.</p><h3>The Modern Mastermind</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1280266\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.9357601713062\" data-width=\"467\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 467px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:193.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1280266\"><img alt=\"Even within modern time, the Red Skull still proved to be ever dangerous as he was before.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-width=\"467\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg 467w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Even within modern time, the Red Skull still proved to be ever dangerous as he was before.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1280266-gil_kane_and_stan_lee__captain_america__page__013.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-width=\"467\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even within modern time, the Red Skull still proved to be ever dangerous as he was before.</figcaption></figure><p>Desperately trying to retrieve the Cube, the Red Skull found himself unable to retrieve it as he witnessed it falling to the bottom of the sea. With no hopes of achieving the god-like powers once more, the Red Skull survived his chance of drowning by the effects of the Cosmic Cube. Setting aside his goals for godly powers, Red Skull decided to take his role as a criminal mastermind and come up with an elaborate plan to take over the world and gain his revenge against Captain America. Residing within one of his islands, the Red Skull would develop a series of robots and equipment to help serve his plans. Realizing that Bucky was his best advantage over Captain America, Red Skull would construct a robot duplicate of Captain America’s former sidekick and trick the hero through into a trap by having the robot contact him through a televised signal. With his plan in motion, Red Skull would also abduct both super-criminals <a href=\"/atlas/4005-3277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3277\"> Power Man</a> and <a href=\"/swordsman-duquesne/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\"> Swordsman</a> to battle the abducted Captain America in a staged fight.</p><p>As both villains almost managed to gain a victory over the hero, Captain America would find himself as the victor and would realize that the Red Skull masterminded the trap. Setting a Gauntlet of traps and robots after the hero, Red Skull would attempt an unsuccessful escape from Captain America.</p><p>As the Red Skull was about to gain another defeat, the tables would turn as he managed to hold <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\"> New York City</a> hostage with one of his devices and force Captain America to side with him for the next twenty four hours. Taking great pride and enjoyment at letting the world know that the hero has sided with the Red Skull and proudly proclaimed him as a traitor among his own country. Taking the abuse, Red Skull would try to end Captain America’s life within the last moments of the deal and hijack a submarine through means of using a mind control device. Managing to escape the Red Skull’s trap, Captain America would successfully track the Red Skull down, rescue the crew, and rig the submarine to explode. As Red Skull remained unaware of what was happening, Captain America would send a video message to him mentioning of what just took place. Before Red Skull could react, the Red Skull would meet another supposed fate when the submarine exploded.</p><h3>Red Skull and The Exiles</h3><p>Surviving his recent encounter with Captain America, the Red Skull would find himself re-establishing on another one of his personal islands that was ran by a group of Nazi criminals known as the Exiles. Reforming his group of Exiles and their personal army of henchmen, Red Skull would once again catch the attention of Captain America as he attempted to have one of his henchmen reawaken a dormant Sleeper. Even though Captain America has already destroyed three of them, Red Skull strongly believed that this version of the Sleeper would possibly help him achieve his goals of world domination. Successfully, the Red Skull managed to reawaken the Sleeper, but found himself unable to control the rampaging robot. As the robot attacked and defeated Captain America by throwing the hero into the ocean, the robot continued on a path of destruction. With the combined efforts of <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Captain America</a>, <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\"> Sharon Carter</a>, and <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\"> Nick Fury</a>, all three managed to bring down this rampaging robot and foil Red Skull’s attempt for world domination.</p><p>Knowing that his robot failed, the Red Skull would proudly realize Captain America’s weakness, which was Cap’s lover <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\"> Sharon Carter</a>. Later, the Red Skull’s henchmen would attempt on kidnapping both Captain America and Sharon Carter. Being taken to Exile Island, Captain America blindly fights an army of henchmen and finds himself defeated by a surprise attack from the Red Skull. Deciding to have Captain America forced within his grasp rather than instantly killing, Red Skull would attach a piece of nuclear tape on the back of Captain America’s neck, forcing the hero to become his slave. Giving the Red Skull the capability to remotely contacting Captain America and easily forcing him to obey his commands. Because of this, Red Skull decided to let the revived Captain America and Sharon Carter to easily escape from his thrall. Carefully planning the details of his plans, Red Skull would secretly place a bomb within <a href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\"> Washington D.C.</a> that would remotely blow up by his command. Unaware of the nuclear tape, Captain America began to experience frequent headaches as a side-affect and attempted to have himself looked at by a medical doctor.</p><p>Remotely contacted by the Red Skull, he briefed him of the tape on the back of his neck and that he has now became his slave. Red Skull also threatened to detonate the bomb within Washington DC if the tape was tampered or removed. Forcing the hero to return to Exile Island, the hero found himself fighting the Exiles. Managing to singly defeat each Exile member, the Red Skull would attempt to blow Washington DC anyways, but found the detonator unresponsive due to <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Tony Stark</a> finding and diffusing the bomb. With his plans backfiring against him, Red Skull gathered his team of Exiles and managed to escape. Later Captain America successfully had the nuclear tape removed from his neck and no longer in Red Skull’s control.</p><h3>The Falcon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1237494-captain_america_120_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1237494\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.322375397667\" data-width=\"943\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 943px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1237494-captain_america_120_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1237494\"><img alt=\"Red Skull's biggest plan was Falcon, where Red Skull planned for the new hero to betray him after gaining Captain America's trust.

However, this plan backfired and Red Skull found himself creating one of Marvel's most enduring and successful partnerships.</figcaption></figure><p>Remembering the potential he had of ruling the world if he simply had the Cosmic Cube within his hands, Red Skull and his team of Exiles desperately kept an eye out for any signs of the Cube’s emergence. Luck would strike for Red Skull when a fisherman found the Cube and instantly attacked the poor soul and found himself in possession of the Cube once more. Expecting to be rewarded for their efforts, the Exiles would find themselves betrayed by Red Skull as he expressed his godly power onto them. During this time, Red Skull would encounter Samuel Wilson whose plane crashes onto Exile Island. Using the cube to convert Samuel’s past and giving him a mental link with his pet bird Red Wing, Red Skull would use another attempt on emotionally defeating Captain America by predicting that Samuel would act as an ally for Captain America and later betray him.</p><p>Instantly going after Captain America himself, the Red Skull would quickly hunt down the hero and torment him in an unfair fight. Taking pride with his powers against his enemy, Red Skull decided torment him further by switching bodies. With the Red Skull’s conscience in Captain America’s body, and Captain America's within the Red Skull. Red Skull took great enjoyment on discriminating Captain America’s name while his allies and the Exiles who wanted revenge for Red Skull’s recent betrayal chased the hero down, all believing that he was the real Red Skull. As Samuel would help Captain America escape, both men found themselves becoming allies as Red Skull predicted. Training and encouraging Samuel to take up a costume role, both men would find themselves fighting and defeating the Exiles. When the moment came where both heroes would finally face against the Red Skull, Red Skull would find his plan backfiring against him when Samuel (who’s now known as the <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\"> Falcon</a>) would side with the Captain and help the hero on defeating the villain and regaining his body. What was believed to be a fool-proof plan that would ruin his most hated enemy, Red Skull would find himself accidentally creating one of the most enduring and heroic partnerships within the Marvel Universe.</p><h3>Taking over Latveria</h3><p>It would later be revealed that during this time, the Red Skull desired an heir and found he fathering a child from a washerwoman who worked on Exile Island. Dying at childbirth, the woman gave birth to a girl, the gender that the Red Skull didn’t desire to be his heir. Much like what his drunken father did to him as a newborn, the Red Skull spat on the dead woman’s face and decided to throw the baby into the sea. Halted by the woman who helped with the birth, <a href=\"/mother-night/4005-28055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28055\"> Susan Scarbo</a> convinced the Red Skull to spare the child and was instructed to personally raise the child as he continued on his criminal career. After his prior defeat within the hands of his most hated enemy, Red Skull decided to focus on his main goals of ruling the world rather than by gaining his revenge.</p><p>Upon learning that the country known as Latveria was without a ruler, Red Skull reformed with the Exiles and together they took over Latveria. With the population under his command, the Red Skull turned Dr Doom’s beloved country into a developing Reich and a stepping-stone towards the Red Skull amassing his own army and possibly ruling the world. Later the Red Skull and his team of Exiles would find themselves battling the returning Dr Doom. In an intense fight, the dictator of Latveria managed to reclaim Latveria and defeat the Red Skull and his team of Exiles by using a shrink ray on them.</p><h3>Terror within Las Vegas</h3><p>Managing to revive from Dr Dooms defeat, the Red Skull parted from the Exiles and decided to create chaos within Harlem as a disguised leader of the group known as the People’s Militia. Taking the alias known as “The Man”, Red Skull tried to create a riot among the black population. Gaining the attention of both Captain America and Falcon, both heroes unmasked Red Skull and foiled his plans when the Militia refused to side with him and abandoned the cause. Realizing that his goals would never be successful with Captain America constantly foiling them, he regained his sights on ridding his enemy once and for all in probably one of his most elaborate schemes within his dark career. Relocating to <a href=\"/las-vegas/4020-55734/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55734\"> Las Vegas</a> after learning of a <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\"> HYDRA</a> faction residing within the city, Red Skull secretly took over as the <a href=\"/supreme-hydra/4005-16040/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16040\"> Supreme Hydra</a> and revived the group from underground. However, his true goals and reasons for relocating to Las Vegas was to unearth the fifth Sleeper, which was a much more powerful version than the recent.</p><p>Realizing that <a href=\"/richard-fisk/4005-14570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14570\"> Richard Fisk</a> was among the organization and quickly rising through the ranks, Red Skull saw another potential threat that could create more of a challenge for Captain America seeing how Fisk’s father was the notorious Kingpin of Crime. Richard Fisk soon reached the rank of Supreme Hydra as Red Skull intended and predicted that his current status would not only gain the attention of Fisk’s father, but also giving control of the organization over to his father. As Captain America, Falcon, and SHIELD caught attention of Kingpins operations, Red Skulls plans were going perfectly. After the heroes managed to destroy Fisk’s organization and defeat Kingpin himself, the Red Skull finally decided to reveal himself and the final part of his plans. Revealing that he duped the Kingpin and his son the entire time through a holographic projection, Red Skull would lure the Captain into a trap by attacking him with the Sleeper.</p><p>By piloting and steering the robot himself into a mindless rampage throughout Las Vegas, Red Skull vowed to stop his destruction upon the city if Captain America surrendered to him. Refusing Red Skull’s demands, Captain America, Falcon, SHIELD, and Kingpin's underlings all attacked the Sleeper as it began to decimate the city and successfully killing hundreds of innocent civilians with a poisonous gas. Before the robot could cause any more destruction, Captain America successfully penetrated the Sleeper’s defenses and sabotaged the robot into an explosion. Even though Red Skull appeared to be dead within the explosion, he managed to escape moments prior to the Sleeper exploding.</p><h3>The Violent Death of a Captain America</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-734991\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2121212121212\" data-width=\"297\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 297px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-734991\"><img alt=\"Angered at how another would take Captain America's role, Red Skull would violently torture and kill this new hero on his very first patrol.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" data-width=\"297\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg 297w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Angered at how another would take Captain America's role, Red Skull would violently torture and kill this new hero on his very first patrol.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/37015/734991-roscoe2.jpg 297w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 297px) 100vw, 297px\" data-width=\"297\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Angered at how another would take Captain America's role, Red Skull would violently torture and kill this new hero on his very first patrol.</figcaption></figure><p>After recently battling the criminal organization known as the <a href=\"/secret-empire/4060-15136/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15136\"> Secret Empire</a>, Captain America was shocked upon the discovery of the groups leader Number #1, who was known to be a high ranking government official. This discovery traumatized Steve Rogers and caused him to give up his mantle as Captain America and continue on his costumed career as a non-government sponsored hero known as <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\"> Nomad</a>. With his partner Falcon still continuing his costumed career, he desperately tried to find a replacement for the Captain America mantle. Even though Falcons first choices weren’t successful, he would finally find a replacement with a man known as <a href=\"/roscoe/4005-37717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-37717\"> Roscoe</a>. Known to be a huge fan of Captain America, Roscoe proudly took up wearing the mantle and proved more than successful than what Falcon had hoped for after training him on how to be Captain America. However, both Roscoe and Falcon would find themselves instantly unsuccessful when stumbling upon one of the Red Skull’s schemes.</p><p>Capturing both heroes, the Red Skull was enraged when learning that he was fighting against a fake Captain America. Red Skull would respond to this by violently torturing and killing Roscoe, and physically beating Falcon to a pulp while demanding that he produce the real Captain America when they meet the next time. Leaving both men for Rogers to see, this inspired him to return to his role as Captain America and both heroes would track down the Red Skull for killing Roscoe. As Red Skull began an assassination campaign, he proved successful by killing a businessman in public, but later was opposed by both Captain America and Falcon. Almost killing Captain America with his “Dust of Death”, Red Skull knew that his defeat was imminent and without the aid of the Cosmic Cube, Red Skull successfully revived Falcon’s pre-programmed mind onto attacking Captain America. Making his escape, both heroes found themselves fighting until Falcon shook off Red Skull’s commands long after the Red Skull was gone.</p><h3>The Conquering Red Skull</h3><p>Red Skull would later relocate to Great Britain and successfully create chaos and terrorism for the country. Instantly making his attempt on reviving his own Nazi party, Red Skull would find a new enemy facing him, another hero who took pride within his country known as <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\"> Captain Britain</a>. Of course Red Skull’s actions managed to attract Captain America’s and SHIELD's attention to where an alliance was formed on attempting to put an end to the Red Skull’s villainy. Battling both heroes, Red Skull made several attempts on ruining or controlling Great Britain, even going as far as kidnapping and attempting to kill the Prime Minister himself. But with combined efforts, <a href=\"/captain-britain/4005-7477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7477\"> Captain Britain</a> was proven successful at ending Red Skull’s attempts and driving him out of Great Britain and moving onto Latveria. This time Red Skull decided to take over Latveria by simply killing Dr Doom, which easily proved successful seeing how Latveria was temporarily ruled by <a href=\"/prince-rudolfo/4005-35539/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35539\"> Prince Rudolfo</a> who was disguised as <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\"> Dr Doom</a>.</p><p>With Latveria at his command, Red Skull would discover a machine known as the Hypno-Ray which could cause the population of world to be at his command. With the combined efforts of Dr Doom, Captain America, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\"> Namor</a>, and the <a href=\"/shroud/4005-13844/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13844\"> Shroud</a>, they successfully penetrated Red Skull’s forces as Dr Doom chased after fleeing Red Skull to the moon for a final fight. As both villains fought each other in an intense battle, Red Skull’s attempt to use the Hypno-Ray was foiled by the Shroud and Dr Doom ultimately defeated the Red Skull in combat and left him to die on the moon.</p><h3>Old Allies</h3><p>Mere moments before dying, Red Skull would find himself saved by an old ally, the <a href=\"/hate-monger/4005-12064/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12064\"> Hate-Monger</a>, also known as Adolf Hitler. Even though Red Skull was Hitler’s right-hand man during World War II, both Hitler and Red Skull didn’t fully trust each other. Introducing another ally from WWII, Arnim Zola would find himself becoming a very close and useful ally for the Red Skull throughout his continuing career. As both villains assisted with each other’s goals, Red Skull would help finance Arnim Zola’s experiments by killing and masquerading as <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\"> Cyrus Fenton</a> to have access to his fortune. As Hate-Monger transferred his mind into the super powered clone known as <a href=\"/hate-monger/4005-12064/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12064\"> Nazi X</a>, Arnim Zola would attack Captain America with his powerful creation Doughboy, yet both villains would find their attempts foiled by the combined efforts of Captain America, Sharon Carter, and Donna Marie which ended by Zola’s castle nearly ruined and Nazi X’s body destroyed.</p><p>With Red Skull attempting to build a machine known as the Death’s Head Satellite and with Hate-Monger’s assistance, he would use this machine upon <a href=\"/shield-helicarrier/4055-40700/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40700\"> SHIELD’s Helicarrier</a> causing all the SHEILD agents upon the Helicarrier to resemble and act as the Red Skull himself. But Red Skull’s attempt on taking over the Helicarrier was foiled by Captain America and the SHIELD agents was restored to normal, yet this stunt left Captain America suffering from temporary blindness. Both Red Skull and Hate-Monger later traveled to Exile Island on their attempt on recreating the Cosmic Cube. However, both criminals found their partnership coming to an ending with one of them obviously backstabbing each other for means of gaining power from the Cosmic Cube and that the island was invaded by an Israeli commando known as Yousof Tov who attempted to capture both men for their war crimes. Defeating Tov and making him a prisoner among Exile Island, both men would also capture top scientists from several agencies such as SHIELD and AIM to aid them on recreating the Cube.</p><p>Managing to recreate a Cosmic Cube, Red Skull was the only one who was aware that the Cube was incomplete and set a trap from his soon-to-be enemy when deciding to keep this information hidden from Hate-Monger. As Hate-Monger transferred his conscious into the Cube, he realized that he was trapped within Cube and settling the differences between Red Skull and Hate-Monger as the incomplete Cube became nothing than a mere trophy that was displayed within the Skull House.</p><h3>Das Ende</h3><p>After making one more attempt on ruining and defeating his nemesis Captain America, Red Skull would learn that the experimental gases that kept him from aging was wearing off. Slowly the Red Skull was aging and eventually he would die from old age. Upon learning this, Red Skull decided to make drastic changes of how the course of his death shall take place, and of course how Captain America would be involved. Needing to ensure that there was a heir after his demise, Red Skull would use his Deus Machina to artificially age his young daughter into adulthood, along with four other female orphans who would blindly follow Sinthea as the group known as Sister’s of Sin while Sinthea took up the name <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\"> Mother Superior</a>. However, Red Skull secretly reverted back to his thoughts on how Sinthea wouldn’t succeed as his heir and had her use her powers on Baron Zemo so that he would become Red Skull’s rightful heir after his demise.</p><p>As his daughter was unaware of what Red Skull’s attentions were for Baron Zemo, he had Jack Monroe brainwashed into giving his partner Captain America into giving him a drug that would accelerate his aging. He also managed to brainwash one of Captain America’s friends into becoming the violent Slayer and sending him after Captain America, while <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\"> Sinthea</a>, <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\"> Baron Zemo</a>, and the Sister of Sin would kidnap four of Captain America’s closest friends and allies, such as Captain America’s current girlfriend <a href=\"/bernie-rosenthal/4005-33411/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33411\"> Bernie Rosenthal</a>, Falcon, and his childhood friend <a href=\"/arnie-roth/4005-32774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32774\"> Arnie Roth</a>. Drawing Captain America to the Skull House, Sinthea personally defeated Captain America and helped her father stage a final battle between the two. As Captain America was aged equally as Red Skull, he mentioned that both men would meet their fate and that if Captain America failed to kill the Red Skull in combat, his kidnapped friends would meet their fate. As the two aged men fought, Red Skull would eventually be bested by Captain America and suffer from a heart attack, slowly dying in the arms of his enemy and swearing vengeance for Captain America not killing him in combat.</p><p>As Red Skull passed away, Sinthea seemingly killed Zemo after realizing Red Skull’s plans for him, and spat on her fathers corpse before throwing his deceased body into the father, giving her father the same fate as he gave her mother. With Captain America fully recovering from the incident, Sinthea attempted on continuing her own path with the Sister of Sin with no attentions of reviving her fathers legacy. With the Red Skull legacy burnt along with her deceased father, Captain America would feel relieved that his long-lived enemy has finally met his fate.</p><h3>The Captain</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-810575\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.69343065693431\" data-width=\"685\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 685px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-810575\"><img alt=\"As Mr Smith, Red Skull would successfully ruin Captain America's name when he had the CSA replace Steve Rogers with John Walker.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg 685w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"As Mr Smith, Red Skull would successfully ruin Captain America's name when he had the CSA replace Steve Rogers with John Walker.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg 685w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/810575-captainamerica350seeingred28.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>As Mr Smith, Red Skull would successfully ruin Captain America's name when he had the CSA replace Steve Rogers with John Walker.</figcaption></figure><p>Even though the Red Skull’s name died, Schmidt was far from meeting his fate when his ally Arnim Zola used the DNA samples he acquired from Captain America to clone a new body for Red Skull. Successfully planting Red Skull’s conscious and memory into this new body, Red Skull was fully revived as an equal towards his most hated enemy, Captain America. From there Red Skull decided to take his methods onto a different course, rather than simply gaining his goals from sheer force as the Red Skull, he decided to set his Red Skull identity aside and obtain his goals by being one with society within it’s fields of business and politics. Upon learning of Red Skull’s return, the other Red Skull (Albert Malik) attempted to ensure that he would be the only man who was the Red Skull by sending his top henchmen led by <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\"> Brock Rumlow</a> to assault and kill Schmidt at Zola’s castle. Even though Malik's assault squad instantly failed and all men died besides Rumlow, Schmidt decided to test his new fighting skills against Rumlow and bested the mercenary in combat. Impressed with Rumlow’s display of fighting skills and aggressiveness, Schmidt would hire Rumlow to be his right-hand man.</p><p>Eventually Schmidt would climb through the ranks within business and politics as Mr. Smith and stationed himself within Washington D.C. as powerful figure and managed to develop and fund several organizations. As Mr. Smith, his control within America extended itself with the connections he had with several organizations that were both good and bad. With these groups under his funding, his ability to obtain resources, information, equipment, and etc. increased to where Schmidt was one of the most dangerous men in America. Secretly operating these groups behind scenes and from the Smith Building located in <a href=\"/washington-dc/4020-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55685\"> Washington D.C</a>, it’s possible that even the Red Skull himself was responsible for other tragedies among the Marvel Universe. Most of the groups that Schmidt had under his control were mostly terrorist organizations and mercenaries, however his most powerful connection was with the Director of Commission of Superhuman Activities, Douglass Rockwell. With Rockwell, Schmidt was capable to have Captain America’s finances investigated and have Rockwell force Captain America on abiding his original government contract and have the hero work underneath the governments command. As Schmidt predicted, Steve Rogers relinquished his costume, shield, and identity as Captain America, having Schmidt successfully removing Captain America from his goals. As the CSA replaced the Captain America identity with <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\"> John Walker</a>, Schmidt would act as the puppeteer within most of the events that Walker went through during his time as Captain America.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368654\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6764705882353\" data-width=\"170\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 170px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-368654\"><img alt=\"Red Skull's face now fully becomes the horror that he hid behind for so long.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-width=\"170\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg 170w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull's face now fully becomes the horror that he hid behind for so long.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/368654-24278-red-skull.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-width=\"170\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull's face now fully becomes the horror that he hid behind for so long.</figcaption></figure><p>Easily gaining the advantage of Walker’s aggressive attitude, Schmidt successfully managed to ruin America’s heroic icon when Walker began killing off his enemies. Schmidt also decided to settle the score with the captured Malik by having a rogue <a href=\"/scourge/4005-14461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14461\"> Scourge</a> spring him from prison and ultimately assassinating him after Malik successfully escaped and was about to retake his role as the Red Skull. After Schmidt felt that Walker was no longer useful within his plans and that Steve Rogers was still continuing on as a superhero known as the Captain, he decided to kill two birds with one stone by leading both men into a trap at his Smith Building and ridding his enemies once and for all. Managing to enrage Walker after a staged fight with hired henchmen, Schmidt staged a fight between both Rogers and Walker while gleefully watching from behind the scenes. With Steve Rogers victorious, Schmidt decided to step in and kill the confused Steve Rogers with his Dust of Death. Almost successful, Walker managed to save Rogers by throwing the shield at Schmidt and causing the dust to backfire against Schmidt. Burning his face and turning it into a reddish skull, Schmidt would find himself showing his true identity and retaking his role as the Red Skull once again after managing to flee from the scene.</p><h3>An Assassin Nation Plot</h3><p>Returning to his methods as a terrorist, Red Skull would use one of the terrorist groups within his division, <a href=\"/ultimatum/4060-55767/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55767\"> ULTIMATUM</a>, and attempt to orchestrate a plan to have America collapse from a war with another country known as <a href=\"/symkaria/4020-55938/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55938\"> Symkaria</a>, home of the mercenary known as <a href=\"/silver-sable/4005-7608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7608\"> Silver Sable</a>. Secretly hiring the mutant killer known as <a href=\"/sabretooth/4005-4563/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4563\"> Sabretooth</a> to proceed with Red Skull’s targets for assassination, he staged another to take the fall for assassinating the King of Symkaria. Funding and acting on this operation behind scenes, this eventually captured the attention of both Silver Sable and Captain America to investigate. However, Red Skull didn’t predict Spiderman’s involvement and paid little attention to his involvement, as he believed that <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a> wasn’t a threat to his plans in anyway. With Sabretooth’s involvement discovered and ultimately defeated by both Silver Sable and Spiderman, Red Skull successfully planted evidence of America’s involvement within Symkaria and war was set between both the U.S and Symkaria. However, Red Skull’s plans of a war between both countries found itself foiled by a meddling Spider-Man who infiltrated ULTIMATUM’s hideout and discovered Red Skull’s involvement. As Red Skull revealed his plans to the Web Slinger, he took pity on the hero and attempted on bribing Spider-Man by simply walking away. This attempt went unsuccessful as Spider-Man went against an army of ULTIMATUM guards while Red Skull made his escape. Successfully escaping, Red Skull believed that his plans of a war was still capable of being successful, until Spider-Man presented evidence to the <a href=\"/the-pentagon/4020-55834/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55834\"> Pentagon</a> of Red Skull’s involvement. Upon discovering this later, Red Skull found another enemy among the Marvel Universe that was added onto his list.</p><h3>Acts of Vengeance</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-937513\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.64357682619647\" data-width=\"794\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 794px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-937513\"><img alt=\"Red Skull would even be seen as a worse kind of evil among Marvels most dangerous villains.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg 794w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull would even be seen as a worse kind of evil among Marvels most dangerous villains.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg 794w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/937513-image443.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull would even be seen as a worse kind of evil among Marvels most dangerous villains.</figcaption></figure><p>Red Skull would later be recruited by <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\"> Loki</a> who was disguised power broker, into a group of other criminal masterminds that focused on attacking the heroes with lesser criminals that they are unfamiliar with. Among the group consisted of old enemies such as Dr Doom and Kingpin, but one particular member within the group, <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\"> Magneto</a> would soon gain Red Skull’s attention seeing how Magneto was known to be a Holocaust survivor and who was currently unaware of Red Skull’s background. With Loki duping each member into believing that he was the power behind the group, Red Skull’s alliance among the team was very fragile and unstable seeing how he was by far the most hated one within the group. As each member set about their goals on finding ways to destroy their heroic enemies, Red Skull would recruit the Iron Man villain known as <a href=\"/controller/4005-3232/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3232\"> Controller</a> to use one of slave disks on Captain America’s ally Namor and force both heroes into a fight. Doing so, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\"> Namor</a> would break free from Controllers grasp and foiled Red Skull’s plans of seeing his enemy face defeat within the hands of one of his most trusted allies.</p><p>As Controller went off on his own path after his attempt went unsuccessful, Red Skull would have <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\"> Crossbones</a> and Voice force Controller into working with Red Skull and help him force Loki under his control, which proved unsuccessful. Matters went for the worse after a brief bickering between Red Skull and Magneto, later learning of Red Skull’s history and decided to attack the Nazi criminal in his office. As Magneto went through a series of traps and instantly taking out both Crossbones and Controller, he successfully managed to track down and kidnap the Red Skull. Locking him into a cell hidden deep within the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\"> Hellfire Club</a> Mansion with no light and a limited supply of water, Magneto would force Red Skull to pay for his crimes against humanity. Managing to recover his tracks, Magneto would use one of Red Skull’s LMD’s to take his place. After Loki was fully discovered and the group disbanded, the LMD was discovered by Crossbones and went about locating his boss with the <a href=\"/skeleton-crew/4060-44134/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44134\"> Skeleton Crew</a>. Managing track his boss to the Hellfire Club Mansion and rescuing him before nearly dying once more, Red Skull would share no regrets for what he has done and still continued on his goals of having the world placed underneath his heel.</p><h3>Streets of Poison</h3><p>Red Skull next decided to take a different approach on destroying America, and that was having it fall victim to his newly designed and devastating drug known as “Ice”. Manufacturing the drug and peddling it onto the streets, Red Skull’s operations would not only attract Captain America (who also managed to accidentally have the drug in his system) but also the Kingpin of Crime as well. Seeing the Kingpin as a possible threat towards Red Skull’s plans, he had Crossbones make an attempt on assassinating Kingpin, which proved unsuccessful. Kingpin responded back by having <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\"> Bullseye</a> make his attempt on assassinating the Red Skull. Bullseye’s attempt on Red Skull’s life found itself accomplished until it was later revealed that Red Skull secretly had an LMD physically running the operations within New York. Knowing that Red Skull wasn’t an easy target, even to the likes of Bullseye, Kingpin managed to personally settle this dispute with the Red Skull at an abandoned football stadium. With both men showing up and giving their word of a fair fight, they would strip to their undergarments and seal themselves within a bullet-proof glass dome to ensure that their dispute was undisturbed by others. With both Kingpin and Red Skull finally settling their differences in an intense fight, Kingpin managed to get the better of the Red Skull, forcing him into submission and quitting his drug operations within Kingpin’s territory.</p><h3>Most Wanted</h3><p>Eventually Red Skull’s activities would be noticed across the countries of the world to where a group of heroes within Germany known as Schutz Heiligruppe would make their attempt on bringing Red Skull to justice for his crimes against humanity. Led by <a href=\"/hauptmann-deutschland/4005-28054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28054\"> Hauptmann Deutschland</a>, the group would raid Castle Zola and destroy all the Red Skull clones and equipment that could possibly have the Red Skull make his return after his death. As Hauptmann took the disguise as one of Red Skulls hired underlings and stalked him while waiting for the right moment to strike at Red Skull, he would finally make his move when being disguised as one of Red Skull’s training partners who were disguised as Captain America. As the other trainees found themselves brutally murdered, Hauptmann would have <a href=\"/blitzkrieger/4005-44965/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44965\"> Blitzkrieger</a> teleport both men out of Castle Zola and onto their aircraft quickly returning back to Germany.</p><p>Knowing that Red Skull’s Skeleton Crew was bound to follow, both groups found themselves in an intense confrontation that ended with the Skeleton Crew being captured as well. However, before sentence could be carried out on Red Skull and his Crew, three of Arnim Zola’s bioplastoids who were disguised as Avengers would demand Red Skull and his crew to be taken into their custody and be tried for his crimes in the United States. Handing the criminals over, <a href=\"/hauptmann-deutschland/4005-28054/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28054\"> Hauptmann</a> felt uneasy at current situation and would later realize that the Red Skull successfully escaped from his clutches after contacting Captain America ensuring that the Red Skull returned to America. Realizing that tension would be rising for Red Skull and his Crew, he would have the rogue Scourge murder bioplastoids of himself, Crossbones, and his daughter Sin while he took hiding within another hideout within <a href=\"/colorado/4020-55782/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55782\"> Colorado</a>. As both Captain America and Schutz Heiligruppe investigated Red Skull’s hideout, they would discover the deceased bioplastoids Red Skull, Crossbones, and <a href=\"/mother-night/4005-28055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28055\"> Mother Night</a>. Despite how the scene didn’t make sense to Captain America, both heroes would be fully convinced that they would see the last of the Red Skull.</p><h3>The Viper and the Skull</h3><p>After successfully faking the deaths of himself, Crossbones, and Mother Night, Red Skull and his crew relocated themselves to the Colorado Mountains. It would also be recognized that both the Red Skull and Mother Night currently was or has been lovers during their time working together. As the tension decreased and the authorities fully believed that Red Skull was officially dead, Red Skull would find himself developing a temper and acting irrational towards his own staff and crew. Feeling that his team was in need for new recruitment, he would hire the nihilist <a href=\"/viper/4005-3420/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3420\"> Viper</a> to take over the role of Mother Superior and as Red Skull’s lover. Of course Red Skull’s crew didn’t agree with his choice and this found himself firing his right-hand man. But none took more of an effect from this than Mother Night, who was jealous as to how Red Skull shared an affair with another woman and completely ignoring her. Assigning Mother Night with the task of finding a replacement for Crossbones, she would find the mercenary known as <a href=\"/cutthroat/4005-3236/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3236\"> Cutthroat</a>, whom she would soon develop a secret affair with later on. Taking notice of two criminals known as <a href=\"/blackwing/4005-14571/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14571\"> Blackwing</a> and <a href=\"/jack-olantern/4005-40901/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40901\"> Jack O Lantern</a> in action, he next ordered Mother Night to recruit them into his crew.</p><p>However this mission found itself backfiring when she found herself apprehended and later posting her own bail. Her capture verified that Red Skull’s death was in fact a fake and that authorities are now aware that he’s still alive and wanted. This led Red Skull into brutally beating Mother Night and leaving her in a state of pity as he continues his next goals as a wanted man alongside with Viper. As both villains continued on with their own personal chaotic goals, Red Skull would find himself crossing paths with the Hulk. Hiring the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\"> Juggernaut</a> and creating the super powered monster known as Piecmeal, Red Skull would use both villains to help him brainwash the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\"> Hulk</a> into joining his cause and to attack the Avengers. This plan found itself foiled as the Hulk shrug off the effects and defeated Red Skull’s henchmen. Later Red Skull would discover Viper's activities and realized that she was using his funds to cause the population within the world to go blind. Knowing the long-term damage of goal, Red Skull would ironically hire Silver Sable and her team known as Wildpack to foil Viper's goals. This would cease the relationship between the Red Skull and Viper and eventually find itself replaced to its original state with Mother Night.</p><h3>Unexpected Allies</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1486801\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48285714285714\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1486801\"><img alt=\"Upon learning of a greater threat, Red Skull and Captain America found themselves allied to stop Hitler's return.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Upon learning of a greater threat, Red Skull and Captain America found themselves allied to stop Hitler's return.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/47635/1486801-a2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Upon learning of a greater threat, Red Skull and Captain America found themselves allied to stop Hitler's return.</figcaption></figure><p>When Captain America’s body began to deteriorate from the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\"> Super-Soldier Serum</a>, Red Skull would also learn that he too was suffering from the same fate due to the fact that his body is a clone of Steve Rogers. As Red Skull predicted, the hero would eventually find a cure for his condition to where Red Skull hid and stalked Rogers while waiting for the right moment to strike. Finally the moment would come when another Captain America villain known as <a href=\"/superia/4005-25690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25690\"> Superia</a> would create a cure for Captain America’s condition and attempt to make a deal with the dying hero for his future services. Denying the cure, Red Skull would step in and take the only cure for himself while killing Superia to ensure that there would be no possible way of preventing his worst enemies death.</p><p>Even though Red Skull believed to have seen the last of Captain America, matters would turn for the worst when he learned that the dysfunctional Cube that contained Hitler’s conscious was stolen by a neo-nazi faction known as Kubekult. The cult wanted to not only restore Hitler’s form, but increase him with powers by spiking the cube itself with energy. Forced in an alliance with Sharon Carter, Red Skull found himself with no other option but to revive his recently deceased enemy to help him prevent Hitler’s return. Managing to revive the Captain with a blood transfusion that stabilized his Super-soldier serum, Captain America would attempt to go inside the Cube and take out Hitler’s conscious while both Red Skull and Sharon Carter handle the Kubikult members. Secretly the Red Skull planned to trap Captain America inside and hoping to both rid his enemy once and for all and to gain unlimited power once again. But Red Skull’s plan found itself foiled by Captain America’s display of willpower and having his plans discovered by the hero who responded by smashing the Cube, which caused the Red Skull to revert into a living shadow.</p><h3>Cosmic-Powered</h3><p>Red Skull would make his return when the being known as <a href=\"/korvac/4005-14467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14467\"> Korvac</a> (who was Kang in disguise) would not only revive the Red Skull into normal form, but also equip him with the powers of the Cosmic Cube. As Red Skull’s powers increase after obtaining more power from <a href=\"/galactus-ship/4055-55839/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55839\"> Galactus's ship</a> and under Korvac's guidance, Korvac secretly manipulated both Captain America and Red Skull into a fight that would end with the Red Skull’s death and hoping to achieve the godly power for himself. As predicted, Captain America was left with little choice but to kill the Red Skull and found himself battling Korvac within the 31 century. Upon realizing that Red Skull’s death was the key start for Korvac’s gain of cosmic powers, Captain America managed to return back to the moment before he killed Red Skull and prevented his death.</p><p>Even though Korvac’s plan was foiled, the cosmic powered Red Skull still was threat to the world that took the efforts of Captain America, Sharon Carter, and Korvac who found himself annihilated by the cosmic powered villain. Unable to physically beat the Red Skull, Captain America tricked the Red Skull into disintegrating himself and the Cube as well. Once more believing to be dead, the Red Skull found himself teleported and returned to normal.</p><h3>America Lost</h3><p>Red Skull’s last course of action before losing his cosmic powers was forming an entity that was made of nothing more than pure hatred. He formed this entity into the being known as Hate-Monger, who closely resembled Hitler and was more controlled by the Red Skull himself. Having Hate-Monger hidden in disguise, both Red Skull and Hate-Monger managed to successfully hijack SHIELDS helicarrier and using it for gaining access to equipment that would have the America fall under the spell of Hate-Monger. Gaining the attention of Nick Fury and Captain America, both heroes would find themselves unprepared for the Red Skull when finally locating the hijacked helicarrier. With Captain America almost falling to his death from an unexpected trap after trying to capture the Red Skull among the helicarrier, Nick Fury didn’t fare any better when he fell victim to a group who was under the hatred influence of the Hate-Monger. With Nick Fury captured and forced by the Red Skull to witness America destroy itself, Captain America and Namor would interrupt Red Skulls plan as both heroes found themselves in an intense battle with the Hate-Monger. Breaking free from Hate-Mongers influence, and managed to influence those who were under Hate-Mongers influence to think positively, causing the Hate-Monger to dissipate. With his plans foiled and his partner gone, Red Skull was left with a violent defeat in the hands of Captain America before finally being incarcerated.</p><h3>Red Zone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4299667\" data-ratio=\"0.69638554216867\" data-width=\"1245\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1245px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4299667\"><img alt=\"Red Skull defeated by Black Panther\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 1245w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull defeated by Black Panther\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 1245w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4299667-skull.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull defeated by Black Panther</figcaption></figure><p>The Red Skull later returned, posing as a politician named <strong>Dell Rusk</strong>.

Upon seeing Bucky Barnes who was contained in a tube and something very valuable to use against Captain America, Red Skull tried to bargain with Lukin who only agreed to such a transaction by trading him with the Cosmic Cube that was currently in Red Skull’s possession (possibly the same imperfect Cosmic Cube that was used to trap Hitler’s conscious). However, as Red Skull stalked Captain America, the revived Bucky Barnes under Lukin’s orders assassinated him and obtained the Cube for Lukin as well. With Red Skull officially believed to be dead, it would later be found out that Red Skull transferred his conscious inside the Cube itself.</p><h3>Twenty-First Century Blitz</h3><p>Red Skull’s last act of transferring his conscious into the Cube found itself sharing minds with Lukin when he began using the Cube’s powers. Unaware of this and how the Cube was draining Lukin’s life force away, Red Skull began controlling Lukin’s body at times and forcing Lukin to partake in his schemes of killing Captain America. Approaching <a href=\"/master-man/4005-15205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15205\"> Max Lohmer</a> and his gang of skinheads for employment, Red Skull would recreate a new <a href=\"/master-man/4005-15205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15205\"> Master Man</a> who sent him and his gang to help Red Skull wreak havoc in <a href=\"/london/4020-55798/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55798\"> London</a>. As Master Man and his gang proved unsuccessful against Captain America, <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\"> Winter Soldier</a>, <a href=\"/union-jack-chapman/4005-3223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3223\"> Union Jack</a>, and <a href=\"/spitfire/4005-7586/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7586\"> Spitfire</a>, Red Skull awoke a new and much more powerful Sleeper to proceed with Red Skull’s goals. Even with the heroes defeating the robot and foiling Red Skull’s plans, secretly he was forming another plan that involved Crossbones and his daughter Sin.</p><h3>The Drums of War</h3><p>Probably the luckiest moment in Red Skull’s career was during the events of the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\"> Civil War</a>. Seeing his most hated enemy forced underground and branded as an enemy of America, Red Skull slowly began recruiting and forming a group that would help him proceed with his plans of killing Captain America and reviving himself into a body of his own. Predicting the outcome of the current events with <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\"> Iron Man</a> and Captain America, Red Skull would have <a href=\"/dr-faustus/4005-34185/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34185\"> Dr Faustus</a> brainwash Sharon Carter into secretly killing Captain America and hire Crossbones to take the fall for the Captains death when the moment was right. As predicted, Red Skull proceeded with his plans when Captain America was detained and was successfully responsible for killing Captain America.</p><p><strong>The Death of Captain America</strong></p><p>In what was known to be the darkest chapter within Marvel history, Captain America’s death not only influenced Bucky Barnes to take up Steve Rogers mantle and shield, but also gave Red Skull more opportunities to cripple and ruin America. As Bucky felt that he didn’t deserve such a right to take up the Captain America mantle, he attempted to take out Lukin/Red Skull himself, only to find himself captured and imprisoned. Realizing that Red Skull was behind the events and not Lukin, Bucky escaped captivity with the help of Sharon Carter (who was also in captivity) and decided to fight against the Red Skull and his forces as the new Captain America. With Bucky and Black Widow struggling on defeating the Red Skull, they were unaware of his true goals and plan’s that found itself reaching inside the White House. Senator <a href=\"/senator-wright/4005-53527/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-53527\"> Gordan Wright</a> was Red Skull’s true plan on taking down America and after a series of staged attacks and events that involved the <a href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\"> Grand Director’s</a> return, Red Skull’s plans would finally be discovered and foiled as Bucky forced Wright to step down from the election by threatening to expose his ties with the Red Skull.</p><p>Red Skull also planned to transfer his conscious into Sharon Carters unborn child, which eventually found itself unsuccessful due to Red Skull’s daughter, Sin stabbing Sharon that caused her to lose the baby. With both plans foiled, matters would turn for the worst when Sharon Carter managed to escape from Dr Faustus captivity and shoot Red Skull/Lukin, seemingly killing both men. However, once again Arnim Zola would successfully save Red Skull’s conscious and place it within a spare robotic body. Shocked and horrified at his current status, Red Skull quickly sat back and planned for his proper return in a desired body of his own and to see America fully crippled beneath his feet.</p><h3>Captain America: Reborn</h3><p>During <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\"> Norman Osborn's</a> reign as the second most powerful man in America, he would hear of how Steve Rogers may possibly</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069616\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.563358778626\" data-width=\"655\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 655px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069616\"><img alt=\"Red Skull nearly killing Bucky in Captain America's body.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-width=\"614\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg 655w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg 614w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull nearly killing Bucky in Captain America's body.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg 655w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1069616-captain_america_reborn__5_029.jpg 614w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" data-width=\"614\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull nearly killing Bucky in Captain America's body.</figcaption></figure><p>return after understanding how the Avenger was trapped and forced to relive his entire life.Trying to prevent this and taking an advantage of Captain America’s possible return, Osborn would release both Crossbones and Sin from custody to have them locate and recruit Red Skull into joining his goals. Secretly funding and assisting Red Skull’s attempt to reclaim Steve Rogers revived body, Red Skull would ironically gain assistance from Dr Doom to help him with his goals. In a twisted idea to alter the outcome of Steve Rogers return, Osborn wanted Captain America’s return but with the Red Skull being the new Captain America working alongside with him. Successfully claiming Steve Rogers revived body, Red Skull forced Roger’s conscious into his own twisted world where he would be temporarily trapped. As Red Skull (In Captain America’s body) was fighting against Bucky and the Avengers, who would also consciously fight against Steve Rogers who was trying to reclaim his body. Managing to get the best of Bucky in combat, Steve Roger would force Red Skull’s conscious out of his body and back into his robotic form before Red Skull could give the killing blow. In a final attempt, Red Skull would use Pym particles to increase his size which proved unsuccessful as the Avengers took the Red Skull down and destroyed his robotic form.</p><h3>The New Red Skull</h3><p>With Red Skull gone, his daughter Sin suffered injuries that caused her face to melt and turn into a reddish appearance. This caused her to grow mentally unstable and be fully convinced that she was better as a Red Skull than her father ever was.

Instead, he decides to target <a href=\"/x-gene-mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutants</a>, realizing that it will easier to gain control over mankind by uniting them against a common enemy.</p><p>To that end, he digs up the corpse of <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a> and steals his brain, thus giving himself all of the Professor's latent mental abilities.

Having knowledge of several forms of fighting skills that's almost equaled to Captain America, Red Skull is a deadly and formidable fighter that even heroes such as Bucky Barnes and Falcon couldn’t compare with. Aside from his experience with fighting, Red Skull is also proficient with the use of several fire-arms, auto-matics, rifles, knives, and any other forms of weaponry that he feels to be useful for his needs. It’s also known that Red Skull is an experienced master-of- disguise, and also experienced within the fields of sabotage and espionage. During his time within Captain America's cloned body, the body had also maintained the Super Soldier effects that gave Red Skull increased strength, speed, and stamina.</p><p>Red Skull is very well-known for his ability to produce elaborate schemes and his display of strategy. Naturally forming a plan that consists of two or more goals to serve his needs, holding back a hidden plan that wouldn’t be revealed until later, and a fall-back plan in case his current plan tends to fail. After his first death, Red Skull would perform his plans behind the scene’s to where nobody would even expect his involvement. One form of strategy that Red Skull favored was his advantage of his near death experiences, several times Red Skull has performed this feat as an advantage to where even some believed that the Red Skull couldn’t be killed. Aside from his ability to produce elaborate plans, Red Skull does have knowledge and experience within the fields of leadership and is known to be extremely manipulative.</p><p>Probably the one thing that does make Red Skull extremely dangerous is the massive amount of resources and connections he has with various groups, organizations, and other characters within the Marvel Universe. After his second revival and taking the identity known as Mr. Smith, Red Skull developed access within just about everything place throughout the world, even reaching access into the <a href=\"/white-house/4020-56318/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56318\"> White House</a> itself. Funding several groups and holding his own division that consisted a representative from each group he funded, Red Skull was capable of training and creating new costumed heroes and villains, ordering assassinations on any selected target, gain access towards weaponry and equipment, and plus any other desired requests that would serve his own agenda. Because of this Red Skull successfully had Steve Rogers replaced with <a href=\"/usagent/4005-14992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14992\"> John Walker</a> as Captain America, had Albert Malik assassinated, faked his own death several times, and had Captain America shot by Sharon Carter who was currently brainwashed. It’s unclear of the full extent of which groups or individuals were funded or controlled underneath the Red Skull seeing how he strictly acted behind the scenes or that they were unaware of who they are working with.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3363821\" data-ratio=\"0.38860103626943\" data-width=\"1158\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1158px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3363821\"><img alt=\"Red Skull mentally controlling the Scarlet Witch\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 1158w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull mentally controlling the Scarlet Witch\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 1158w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/3363821-avengers00208.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull mentally controlling the Scarlet Witch</figcaption></figure><p>After his first encounter with the Cosmic Cube, Red Skull quickly studied and learned how to use it's powers and control it to where the Cube granted him god-like powers.

It's also known that Red Skull successfully used the Cube to create a being that strongly resembled Hitler (as Hate-Monger) and was made out of pure emotion.</p><p>The clone Red Skull possessed all of the mental abilities of Professor X, including telepathy and the power to bend the minds and wills of others.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>Red Skull has owned various weapons and equipment that he mostly uses to serve his own needs and purposes. With his resources and criminal connections, Red Skull can acquire any type of weaponry of his own choosing such as firearms automatics, explosives, laser rifles, rockets, knives, etc. Aside from hand-held weaponry, Red Skull also has access towards equipment, vehicles, and locations that are secretly hidden in various locations throughout out the world.</p><h3>Dust of Death</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-454138\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.98333333333333\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-454138\"><img alt=\"The Dust of Death became the Red Skull's trademark after learning it's horrific effects.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Dust of Death became the Red Skull's trademark after learning it's horrific effects.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/454138-5zdxxrm.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dust of Death became the Red Skull's trademark after learning it's horrific effects.</figcaption></figure><p>Red Skull’s trademark weapon that he mostly uses for defensive or assassination purposes is his Dust of Death. Developed and manufactured by the Red Skull himself, the Dust of Death is a reddish powdered base substance that has a violent reaction when coming into contact with the skin of the victim. Once contacting the skin, the dust deteriorates and changes the skin into a reddish dyed shriveled appearance, causing a reddish skull when contacting the face of the victim. Strictly using this substance to come into contact with the face of the victim, the victim’s face would quickly change while he or she would die from asphyxiation after inhaling the substance. When Red Skull accidentally used the substance on himself, he survived its devastating effects but was left with a reddish skull appearance. Usually the Dust of Death is kept in a secret compartment that’s mostly hidden within Red Skull’s cigarette holder, a hand-held gun, or placed within any object such as a telephone or a coat.</p><h3>The Cosmic Cube</h3><p>Formerly Red Skull came into possession with more than one Cosmic Cube throughout his career. After acquiring the first Cube, Red Skull was granted god-like powers that caused him to alter reality to his own choosing. Such as switching bodies, creating elemental beings, altering his own appearance, granting powers, creating beings out of pure emotion, and any other known power that he chooses to display at his own will. After losing possession of the recent Cosmic Cube, Red Skull possessed an imperfect Cube that was secretly designed as a trap for his former ally the Hate-Monger. This imperfect Cube only served as a trophy that contained Hitler’s trapped conscious, and the Cube was long forgotten until a neo-nazi cult increased its powers. Possibly the same Cube, Red Skull later possessed another imperfect Cube that granted limited abilities and was used by the Red Skull to transfer his own conscious in and out of the Cube at will. This was the last Cube that was seen in Red Skull’s possession, which was also destroyed by Bucky Barnes.</p><h3>Sleeper Robots</h3><p>Prior to Hitler’s downfall at the end of WWII, Red Skull created and designed various robots that he hid deep underground in various locations throughout the world. Calling these robots Sleepers, they would lay in dormant until the Red Skull himself would activate them. Each robot proving more powerful and different from the other, Red Skull has used these massive Sleepers’s for the purposes of wreaking havoc throughout populated cities. It’s unclear as to how many of these robots Red Skull created or if there are any more hidden deep underground.</p><h3>Life Model Decoy's</h3><p>After taking the role as Mr. Smith, Red Skull would take an advantage of one of his employers known as Machinesmith who designed several Life Model Decoys that the Red Skull strictly used for defense, protection, and other uses that gives Red Skull a higher advantage with his schemes. Holding several of these LMD’s at his command, each LMD is updated with the current events and is fully aware of Red Skull’s status, unless the memory program is either altered or changed. Later Red Skull disbanded his needs for LMD’s and instead used Arnim Zola’s life-like plastoids.</p><p>Aside from his basic usage of weaponry and robots, Red Skull usually has his current location equipped with several death traps and escape routes in case he's either threatened or his base is infiltrated. Even the mutant terrorist Magneto had difficulty capturing the Red Skull due to his series of traps that almost had the Red Skull escape from Magneto's clutches.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3><b>Earth X</b> (Earth-997)</h3><p>Johann Schmidt was killed by Captain America and later, the Red Skull legacy was passed on to <a href=\"/the-skull/4005-10954/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10954\"> Ben Beckley</a>, son of the <a href=\"/comet-man/4005-10953/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10953\"> Comet Man</a>. Ben was later killed by Captain America and later seen with his father.</p><h3><b>Marvel Zombies</b> (Earth-2149)</h3><p>Red Skull is one of the infected and is now a zombie. He is seen finally killing his nemesis, Colonel America, by ripping out the last part of his brain of his head... After Loosing an Arm by Colonel's Shield. His head was Blasted off by <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\"> Spider-Man</a> and finally had his head stepped on by <a href=\"/giant-man/4005-7216/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7216\"> Giant Man</a>... Which, according to him, was fully worth killing his enemy.</p><h3><a href=\"/old-man-logan/4045-55645/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55645\">Old Man Logan</a></h3><p>50 years earlier, in this Universe, the Red Skull had organized all of the villains and had defeated the heroes. In what was left of Washington D.C., the Red Skull was standing on what was left of the U.S. Capitol, with Captain America (Bucky Barnes) laying on the ground, near death, and after Red Skull told Cap about how he's going to tear his country apart and divide it up between the villains, then the Red Skull kills Captain America. 50 years into the future, the Red Skull has become president of his new Nazi Country, he is now wearing the now dead Captain America's uniform. Since the heroes fell, the Red Skull has taken things from other superheroes that are now dead and put them in his trophy room, such as <a href=\"/iron-man-armor/4055-50749/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50749\"> Iron Man's armor</a>, <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\"> Captain America's shield</a>, Thor's helmet, Spider-Man's mask, The Vision's head, and even the Thing's arm.

He only had one night of leave and after three years of not having seen her, passion grew and he accompanied her for the night. Months later it turned out Gail was pregnant but the government did not want to let the Captain America name to be tainted by Gail giving birth to Captain America's child out of wedlock. The government made sure there was no evidence of Gail's pregnancy or birth of the child. So the world thought when Captain America died he was the last hope for a super soldier but the government considered the baby a second chance for a Captain America so they had him taken to a secluded army base where he was to be raised and trained in secret. The boy grew up to be strong, smart, agile, fast and appeared to be surprisingly happy. His abilities far surpassed his father's because the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\"> super-soldier formula</a> was a natural part of his genetic make up unlike his father who was only injected with it. It turns out the boys happiness and kindness was just a act to cover up his truly evil demeanor.</p><p>He had waited years until he was ready to escape the army base he was forced to call home his entire life and at the age of 17, he finally made his move to break free. He brutally fought his way out of the base not only killing the guards in his way but everyone who was residing at that base. All two hundred and forty-seven people lost their life at the hands of what was thought to be the next Captain America. The most shocking part of the boys escape was when he had finished killing everyone in the base, he went into the kitchen, picked up a knife and then proceeded to cut his face off. He did this because he did not want the face his father gave him and thus the Red Skull was born. Over the years, the Red Skull developed a reputation as one of the most deadly assassins in the world. He would usually take on an assignment then disappear for sometimes years at a time until he accepted a new assignment. Steve Rogers was never aware of his son's existence, even after he was recovered from suspended animation until one fateful day after <a href=\"/ultimatum/4045-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55745\"> Ultimatum</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\"> Hawkeye</a> and Captain America were on a mission to stop the terrorist organization <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\"> AIM</a> from looting the <a href=\"/baxter-building/4020-41454/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41454\"> Baxter Building</a> when the two finally met. Captain America boarded an AIM helicopter where the easily dispatched several AIM agents until he came face to fist with the Red Skull. He and Red Skull fought but Red Skull quickly and easily took over the fight. While they fought Captain America was amazed by his foes strength, speed and knowledge, Cap was severely beaten and as the Red Skull was about to throw him out of the helicopter, he told him that he was his son. Captain America eventually went rogue in order to find his son and learn the answers that only The Red Skull can answer.The Ultimates go on a mission to neutralize the Red Skull only to discover he's gotten a hold of the Cosmic Cube. It takes no time for him to defeat the heroes. Captain America uses a teleplane to get to Red Skull's location and he crashes the plane. Captain America contacts Hawkeye and asks for Skull's coordinates, when Hawkeye questioned him on it, Cap simply states \"Because you never miss and I never lose.\" Cap used the teleplanes final teleportation to impale Red Skull through his chest.</p><h3>Thunderguard (Earth-9907)</h3><p>In this universe, Johann Schmidt survived the collapse of the Skull-house that supposedly killed him, and before letting the Nazi's grip on Europe slip through the Axis's fingers he killed Adolf Hitler and took his place. After gaining access to all of the Axis Armies as Hitler's successor, he lead the Nazis into victory and killed everyone who dared to oppose him... Captain America included. At the end of the war, he had successfully destroyed the Allied Countries and ruled the world.</p><p>Years later, he would come across a boy named Victor von Doom in a meeting similar between the one he had between himself and Hitler years ago... Schmidt took Victor under his wing and gave him the title as his heir to his world domination. Victor eventually killed his adopted father and assumed his role as the leader of the Nazi-occupied planet, possibly as Dr. Doom.</p><p><b>Other Media</b></p><h3>Television</h3><h4><strong><a href=\"/the-marvel-super-heroes/4075-322/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-322\">The Marvel Super Heroes</a> (1966)</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437290\" data-ratio=\"0.665\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437290\"><img alt=\"Red Skull in The Marvel Super Heroes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull in The Marvel Super Heroes\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437290-3712102482-12379.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull in The Marvel Super Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Red Skull would make his very first television appearance in 1966 within the Canadian-made cartoon known as <em>The Marvel Super Heroes</em>.

He shares his voice with his Assemble characterization.</p><h4>Marvel Future Avengers (2017)</h4><p>Red Skull appears in the Japanese Avengers anime <em>Marvel Future Avengers</em>, voiced by Motomu Kiyokawa in the Japanese original and by Liam O'Brien in the English dub.</p><h3>Film</h3><p><strong><a href=\"/captain-america/4025-60/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-60\">Captain America</a> (1990)</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1062007\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4683098591549\" data-width=\"284\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 284px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1062007\"><img alt=\"Red Skull in Captain America (1990)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-width=\"284\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg 284w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Skull in Captain America (1990)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/56764/1062007-284px_red_skull_movie.jpg 284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px\" data-width=\"284\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Red Skull in Captain America (1990)</figcaption></figure><p>Red Skull would make his first film debut in the 1990 low budget film known as <a href=\"/captain-america/4025-60/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-60\"> Captain America</a>. Even though the film was anticipated to be the 50 anniversary of Captain America’s first debut within comics, the film found itself receiving poor reviews from critics and other movie viewers as well. Within the film Red Skull is played by actor Scott Paulin and is displayed differently from the comic book version, basically displaying the villain as an Italian fascist.</p><p>First seen as a child who was forced into an experiment, Red Skull would be a man who served underneath Hitler as a horrible super soldier with mutated features that changed his face into a reddish skull. Easily besting Captain America in combat within their first encounter, Red Skull strapped the hero onto a missile and launches it before the hero manages to disrupt the course and force the missile to land into the Alaskan arctic. As Captain America’s frozen body wasn’t found until years later, Red Skull found himself running his own crime family who partook special requests in killing powerful and inspirational Americans, and his newest target was the recent President of the United States, President Thomas Kimball.</p><p>Even though Red Skull went threw extensive plastic surgery to alter his hideous appearance, his appearance was still seen as a hideous form that forced Red Skull to act behind the scenes. With Captain America revived and the Red Skull trying to kill the President and his revived nemesis, Red Skull found himself unsuccessful and killed in a last confrontation with Captain America.</p><h4><a href=\"/captain-america-the-first-avenger/4025-927/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-927\">Captain America: The First Avenger</a> (2011)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1702472\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1829470198675\" data-width=\"2416\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2416px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1702472\"><img alt=\"In \"The First Avenger\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" data-width=\"541\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg 2416w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg 1623w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg 811w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/1702472-fb_03026_v709.cdt.2_1.jpg 541w\"><noscript><img alt=\"In \"></noscript></a><figcaption>In \"The First Avenger\"</figcaption></figure><p>The Red Skull is the primary antagonist in the film <a href=\"/captain-america-the-first-avenger/4025-927/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-927\"> <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a>. In this film, he is portrayed as a <a href=\"/third-reich/4060-49867/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\"> Nazi</a> officer who has become obsessed with the acquisition of occult power, and his own status as \"the superior man\". Prior to the events of the film, he stole Dr. <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\"> Abraham Erskine's</a> <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\"> Super Soldier Serum</a>, despite the fact that it had not been perfected, and injected himself. He thus has enhanced strength, agility and resilience; however, the incomplete serum also alters his physical appearance, giving him the distinctive red skin and skull-like face. He is the leader of HYDRA, the advanced weaponry arm of the Nazi Party that has since broken away from the Nazis and become a cult-like terrorist organization that is fanatically dedicated to serving the Red Skull's aims. He and his followers search for and acquire the \"tesseract,\" also known as the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/4055-40949/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40949\"> Cosmic Cube</a>, from a church in <a href=\"/norway/4020-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55828\"> Norway</a>. With the help of <a href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\"> Arnim Zola</a>, he is able to harness the power of the Cube, which he uses to power new weapons and machinery that he uses to fight Allied forces and further his plans for global domination. He is apparently killed in a climactic battle with Captain America, when he holds the Cosmic Cube without any protective equipment. He appears to disintegrate, and vanishes into the opening into deep space created by the Cube. He is played by Hugo Weaving.</p><h4><strong><a href=\"/captain-america-the-winter-soldier/4025-1542/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1542\">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a> (2014)</strong></h4><p>The Red Skull does not appear directly in the sequel, but images of him can be seen.

However, she was soon banished for being too undisciplined and Amora quickly decided to train herself in the ways of magic by seducing other sorcerers and forcing them to reveal their ancient secrets to her. In time, Amora became one of the most powerful sorceresses in all of Asgard and was also very adept in the use of manipulation and charm in order to get her way.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>Amora first appeared in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/journey-into-mystery-103-the-enchantress-and-the-e/4000-7069/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-7069\">Journey into Mystery #103</a> and was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1027593\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1027593-enchantress15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2007299270073\" data-width=\"274\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 274px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1027593-enchantress15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1027593\"><img alt=\"The Enchantress\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1027593-enchantress15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1027593-enchantress15.jpg 274w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px\" data-width=\"274\"></a><figcaption>The Enchantress</figcaption></figure><p>Amora first appeared as a foe of Thor, albeit with the intention of seducing him and then soon after as an enemy of the Avengers.</p><p><b>Modern Age</b></p><p>Amora's adolescence was explored in the Thor: Son of Asgard mini-series. It was later revealed in the Thor mini series <a href=\"/thor-ages-of-thunder/4050-21355/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21355\">Thor: Ages of Thunder</a> and <a href=\"/thor-reign-of-blood/4050-21895/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21895\">Thor: Reign of Blood</a> that although not strictly a god like other Norse figures in the Marvel Universe, Amora had been known by many 'Godly' names throughout history after reaching adulthood.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Adolescence</h3><p>From a young age, Amora had always desired <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a>, although she admitted that this was only because he preferred <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a> over her. This caused a bitter rivalry with Sif to ensue after Amora attempted to seduce Thor in hopes of keeping him for herself. To do this, Amora allied herself with <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> and the two of them developed a plot in which they manipulated Sif into stealing the Mirror of Mycha from <a href=\"/\">Karnilla</a>'s palace. Once in possession of the mirror, Amora took it so that she could use its power to have Thor for herself. After their success, Amora and Loki decide that the mirror must be returned to its rightful place, lest their plot be discovered. However, they could not do this without the cloth that the mirror was originally draped in, at which point Loki showed his true colors when he stated that he had no connection to their crime, leaving Amora to take the blame if the mirror is not returned. Before Amora could chastise Loki, Sif and <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Brunnhilda</a> appear, demanding that Amora revert her spell on Thor as payment for the return of the mirrors cloth. Amora immediately refused, and the four young gods quickly entered into a brief battle until it is interrupted by Thor who threatened to inform Odin himself about the whole ordeal. Brunnhilda then shattered the mirror, breaking the spell placed on him. With his mind clear, Thor admitted he expected no less from Amora, but was disappointed in Sif because she attempted to use trickery to gain his love, although the two made up before the story's end.</p><h3>Ages of Thunder</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-662497\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/662497-enchantress__by_khari_evans__2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3107221006565\" data-width=\"457\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 457px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/662497-enchantress__by_khari_evans__2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-662497\"><img alt=\"Amora with the Golden Apples of Idunn\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/662497-enchantress__by_khari_evans__2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/662497-enchantress__by_khari_evans__2.jpg 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" data-width=\"488\"></a><figcaption>Amora with the Golden Apples of Idunn</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of Asgard have repeated their lives endlessly through the ages; they have lived, through Ragnarok countless times with their roles and personalities shifting slightly during each retelling of their story. Amora has been known as Freyja, Iduna, Mardol, and Gefn, though even in these iterations she always retains her core attributes: control of powerful magic and unparalleled beauty.</p><p>In '<a href=\"/thor-ages-of-thunder/4050-33275/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-33275\">Ages of Thunder</a>', which tells the story of a long-past cycle, Amora is known as Iduna, the goddess tasked with an immensely important task of collecting the Golden Apples which grew from <a href=\"/yggdrasil-the-world-tree/4020-55875/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55875\">Yggdrasil</a>, the life tree. <a href=\"/golden-apples/4055-56942/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56942\">The Golden Apples</a> were consumed by the Asgardians in order to maintain their youth and power. The apples would only grow if Iduna were present, and only she, the essence of feminine perfection, could remove them, unspoiled, from the tree. During this time, The Enchantress was the object of desire for many. Her beauty caused her to be sought after by a stonemason who was assigned to repair the great wall which surrounded Asgard after an attack by the Frost Giants.</p><p>In a second story of the same cycle, a lost and wandering Loki bargains the Enchantress to the Frost-King so that he may find his way to the Bifrost bridge and back to Asgard. After this deal is struck and the Asgardians are reminded that only the Enchantress can retrieve the Gold Apples that sustain their power and vitality, the Frost giant is slain by Thor, thus allowing the Goddess to return to her garden.</p><p>Amora also obtained the mythical story that centered around the Nordic Goddess Freyja, where she gave herself to three Dwarves in order to obtain an exquisite jeweled necklace that they had created. It was also noted during these stories, that Amora had many lovers and would openly reject <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a>, by refusing to bed with him. This caused him to violently take her newly acquired necklace while also informing her that she had defiled herself when she gave her body to the Dwarves. Out of humiliation and anger, Amora cast a spell which caused the dead on Earth to rise and torture humanity, forcing Thor to intervene and defeat the newly risen army of the dead.</p><h3>Masters of Evil</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651680\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6253968253968\" data-width=\"630\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 630px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:162.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-651680\"><img alt=\"The Enchantress\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-width=\"393\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 630w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 590w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 393w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Enchantress\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 630w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 590w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7884/651680-scan0019.jpg 393w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" data-width=\"393\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Enchantress</figcaption></figure><p>After Amora's initial encounters with <a href=\"/\">Thor</a> left her love-struck, she decided to seduce the God of Thunder in his Donald Blake identity. Amora also attempted to destroy Thor's love interest, <a href=\"/\">Jane Foster</a>, so that he would belong to her completely. Even though Amora was often aided by <a href=\"/\">Loki</a>, her plans were never successful, at least not for long. Amora was soon accompanied by another man named <a href=\"/\">Skurge</a>, who seemed to have fallen madly in love with her and did anything that she required. Amora only took advantage of Skurge's willingness by stringing him along with her feminine wiles, often withholding her favors, and simply using him as her \"muscle\". Amora also briefly served as one of Loki's lieutenants when she and Skurge aided him in his attempt to conquer Asgard. After a streak of crimes against Asgard and Thor, Amora and Skurge were both banished to Earth, where they joined <a href=\"/\">Baron Zemo's</a> original <a href=\"/\">'Masters of Evil'</a>. During this time, Amora and Skurge had allied themselves with <a href=\"/\">Arkon</a>, The <a href=\"/\">Mandarin</a>, and Loki, when they repeatedly faced off against Thor and <a href=\"/\">the Avengers</a>. Amora was occasionally challenged by the <a href=\"/\">Scarlet Witch's</a> mutant gift, when she attempted to divert her divine spells.</p><p>During her time with the <a href=\"/\">Masters of Evil,</a> Amora is noted for giving other super humans their original powers, such as Power Man and <a href=\"/\">Barbara Norris</a> who were given the power of Valkyrie. In order to create the original Power Man, Amora used the deceased Zemo's equipment to give <a href=\"/\">Erik Josten</a> superhuman powers when he helped her fool the public by making them believe that the Avengers had gone berserk. When the \"mad\" <a href=\"/\">Captain America</a> was defeated, many people began to believe that Amora and Power Man were actual heroes. Eventually an unknown man attempted to become their agent, which would make them both rich and famous in the process. However, Power Man admitted their wrong-doing when he confessed that they were not true heroes. Amora then noticed something strange in the \"agents'\" briefcase and forced Power Man to open it, which revealed an active tape recorder. The man revealed himself to be Captain America and entered into a fight with Power Man, though Power Man quickly defeated him. <a href=\"/\">Hawkeye</a>, <a href=\"/\">Quicksilver</a> and Scarlet Witch arrived soon after to continue the battle with Amora. However, Amora, decided to flee after realizing that she had chosen the wrong man to aid her. Power Man clearly lacked a \"killer's\" instinct. Without the Enchantress' protection, Power Man gave himself up, thus allowing the Avengers to clear their name.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-626923\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-626923\"><img alt=\"Amora and Skurge the Executioner\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg 360w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Amora and Skurge the Executioner\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/626923-xbe26x.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Amora and Skurge the Executioner</figcaption></figure><p>Enchantress is soon amused by a man who was able to best her guards and break into her palace. He reveals to her that his only goal is to worship her and that he would give up his birth-right and estate just to do so. Enchantress, grants his wish by turning him into a tree and stating that \"in the spring, the wind rustling through thy leaves will sing my glory. In winter thou shalt stand in mute admiration of my incomparable beauty.\" The Enchantress soon travels to the Fountain of Forever where she learns the location of a dimensional rift that would grant her mystical power that would rival <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin's</a>. Amora soon travels to the location of the rift, which is forming inside a Disco club in Manhattan. At the disco, the Enchantress encounters the mutant known as <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a> for the first time when Amora attempts to take control of the rift by auditioning as a performer for the club, confident that her voice and physical beauty would easily win her the part. This would have been the case had Alison Blaire not auditioned as well. The club manager, though obviously was infatuated with Amora, reluctantly admitted that Dazzler's voice was indeed superior. Enraged at having her plans thwarted and losing to another woman, Amora sought both to claim the mystical energies of the rift and destroy her new found rival by aging Alison to her death during her performance. Unfortunately for the Enchantress, many of the city's super-powered heroes, who saw Dazzler as one of their own, were in the audience in order to lend their support to the young woman. They quickly came to her aid, and in the ensuing battle, Amora was forced to use so much magic that the rift was destabilized. With ultimate power now beyond her grasp, the Enchantress chose to flee, rather than continue to fight a pointless battle.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230248\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230248\"><img alt=\"Enchantress vs Dazzler\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enchantress vs Dazzler\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230248-enchantress5.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enchantress vs Dazzler</figcaption></figure><p>The next time the Enchantress and <a href=\"/\">Dazzler</a> run into each other is at an airport, Dazzler spotted a tall blonde woman surrounded by a group of admiring men. The woman was of course Amora, who quickly teleports Dazzler back to <a href=\"/\">Asgard</a> where they have a brief conversation until the <a href=\"/\">Warriors Three</a> take them to the Court of the Vizier. Once there, Amora claims to have been disrespected by Dazzler and demands a duel, to which Dazzler readily accepts. Although the duel started out with the two women evenly matched, Dazzler is soon able to gain the upper hand, forcing Amora to cease \"playing\" and instead, fight more seriously. She soon begins to drain Dazzler's life force and would have succeeded had it not been for <a href=\"/\">Odin'</a>s timely arrival. When Odin demands to know what is going on, Amora again claims that Dazzler disrespected her when she won the singing contest back at the club. Odin then decides to see who truly has a better voice and sets up another contest, choosing Amora to go first. Although Amora's siren-song mesmerized all of the men in the room, including Odin, Dazzler still proved to be the better singer when Odin declared her the winner and sent her back to Earth.</p><p>At a later point, Amora halts a fight between <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a> and his half-brother <a href=\"/ares/4005-11940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\">Ares</a> by offering both Gods a drink. It quickly became apparent that this seemingly kind gesture is actually a conspiracy to take control of Hercules planned by Amora and Ares when Hercules, after taking a drink from a cup which was filled with water obtained from the Fountain of Eros, begins to declare his undying love for Amora. With Hercules now under her control, Amora immediately decided to take Hercules to Earth in order to battle and defeat the Avengers. When the two Gods arrive, Hercules quickly takes out <a href=\"/\">Quicksilver</a> while the Scarlet Witch sends a help signal to <a href=\"/\">Hawkeye</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>. However, when the two Avengers arrive, they find that Hercules has already taken down <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a> with ease and the Scarlet Witch had just lost a magical battle with the Enchantress. Hawkeye then shoots a special arrow in Hercules' face and with the explosion, Hercules comes back to his senses. Realizing what has occurred, he tells Amora to leave, otherwise he would unleash his wrath upon her. Amora quickly departs in order to avoid this consequence. Soon after, <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a> appears and exiles Hercules from <a href=\"/olympus/4020-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55673\">Olympus</a> for one years time, since he left without permission and chose the love of an Asgardian over his place of birth (although this was told to Zeus by Ares). Hercules quickly opted to become a member of the Avengers right after. Meanwhile, Amora wonders to herself why she did not stay to engage Hercules in battle, and in the end, she comes to the conclusion, that she may possibly be in love with the son of Zeus.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230252\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.88666666666667\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1230252\"><img alt=\"Amora and Lorelei\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Amora and Lorelei\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/30865/1230252-enchantress6.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Amora and Lorelei</figcaption></figure><p>Amora later used her magic to allow Barbara Norris to become the Valkyrie and join the team known as the Defenders, although at one point, Amora poses as the <a href=\"/\">Valkyrie</a> herself and attempts to fight the <a href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders</a> with her team of <a href=\"/lady-liberators/4060-46791/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-46791\">Lady Liberators</a>, but was ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>Later during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a>, Amora was placed on the villains side, although she despised the thought of participating in a gladiatorial event for the amusement of a higher being.

She tries the same tactic on <a href=\"/\">Captain America</a>, but fails and is ultimately defeated by him. With the final battle at an end, Amora kidnaps <a href=\"/volcana/4005-14536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14536\">Volcana</a> by attempting to take her soul to Asgard in order to stop <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, who had obtained the power of the <a href=\"/beyonder/4005-10300/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10300\">Beyonder</a>.

As a result, Amora punches the Lizard and while holding her face and absorbs his soul before ultimately returning to Asgard for good . It was during this time that Amora's sister, <a href=\"/lorelei/4005-45145/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45145\">Lorelei</a> appeared, and it became quite clear that the two had somewhat of an estranged relationship due to some form of rivalry. Part of this rivalry stemmed from a sort of competition to see who would successfully seduce Thor first.</p><p>After this, Amora joined in the battle against <a href=\"/surtur/4005-10967/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10967\">Surtur</a> when he attempted to conquer Asgard, however, he was soon defeated by the united Asgardians. Although it should be noted that Amora most likely joined for selfish reasons, for if the world ended, so too would Amora. Soon after this event, Skurge learned that Amora had been dallying with <a href=\"/heimdall/4005-3508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3508\">Heimdall</a>. Heartbroken, <a href=\"/\">Skurge</a> sacrificed himself after joining Thor and helped in rescuing his allies from Hel. Surprisingly, Amora was grief-stricken after hearing the news of Skurge's death. After his death, Amora still continued her adventures whether or not they were considered 'good' or 'bad' as long as they served her needs in the end. During a later event, Amora refused to sacrifice her life in order to save her sister Lorelei and as a result her sister perished. The Enchantress soon went to <a href=\"/valhalla/4020-56219/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56219\">Valhalla</a> in order to make amends with Skurge and when he harshly rejected her, she used her powers to have <a href=\"/brute-benhurst/4005-87297/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-87297\">Brute Benhurst</a> serve as her new Executioner instead. Amora later returns to Midgard under the guise of Leena Moran, the new roommate of Susan Austin, who worked alongside <a href=\"/thunderstrike/4005-7611/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7611\">Eric Masterson</a>. Amora used Susan's connection with Eric after assuming her form to kidnap Eric simply to lure Thor into a trap. Thor was forced to fight against Loki in order to save Eric. Although Amora had failed in defeating for, she attempted to seduce Eric, but ultimately returns to Asgard where she attempts to duel with Karnilla.

However, the Avengers soon come to rescue their comrades, although they end up defeated and trapped in a machine that drains away their powers and places them into Wonder Man.

However, she did profess true love for him and began to cry before finally departing which almost caused Wonder Man to stop rescuing his friends. Later, Amora attempts to once again seduce Wonder Man in order to help her take over television studios, making her self the star and filling it with \"subliminal suggestions\" that would cause every man in the world to fall in love with her. This would cause a global fan worship, making Amora stronger since she believes that it is through worship that the Asgardians gain power.

Amora continued to unleash a barrage of spells against the Thunder God, while she also chastised his, Loki's, and Odin's arrogant behavior. Thor initially refused to even listen to the Enchantress, calling her a liar as he charged forth to attack her. Though he nearly succeeded, Amora unleashed a spell powerful enough to halt the God of Thunder, and then continued to scold him. It was then that Thor began to heed Amora's word, when she claimed that she, and now Thor himself, were trapped in this realm due to Asgard's placement on Earth. She explained that this was the main cause for their dilemma since, <a href=\"/hela/4005-4342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4342\">Hela</a>, Goddess of Death, had significantly grown in power and would no longer allow them to leave. When Hela appeared, Thor quickly engaged in her in battle but was nearly defeated until Amora intervened, teleporting him away. Hela then turned her wrath toward the Enchantress and the two engaged in their own battle. When Amora was nearly defeated, Hela revealed the source of her new found strength, the Twilight Sword, before unleashing its full power on the Enchantress.</p><p>When Thor engages Hela in one final battle and is nearly defeated, Amora again intervenes to save the Thunder God by teleporting him to the location of his hammer <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>. Amora agrees to put aside her problems with Thor, opting to continue assisting him instead.

When Hela is finally defeated, Thor uses the Twilight Sword to return the realms to the state in which they were before Hela had intervened. Amora then offers to teleport the three Avengers back to Earth, and jokingly asks for the Twilight Sword as payment. Amora does not return to Asgard with Thor, though he noted that her assistance would not be forgotten.</p><h3>Asgardia</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2918686\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/2918686-enchanat.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3945578231293\" data-width=\"441\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 441px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55328/2918686-enchanat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2918686\"><img alt=\"Amora decapitates Blake\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" data-width=\"458\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 441w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Amora decapitates Blake\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 441w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" data-width=\"458\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Amora decapitates Blake</figcaption></figure><p>Amora later returns on Earth in Oklahoma with <a href=\"/donald-blake/4005-84227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84227\">Dr. Donald Blake</a>.

Magneto's Cabal was made up of villains, and the group tore the sentinels apart. They had less success against the Red Onslaught. Amora had managed to hold his powers at bay, and nearly conquered him herself by casting a love spell. The spell eventually worked, and Amora was considering using the Red Onslaught as her puppet. She would have him fight for her and crush her enemies, but her concentration - and therefore, the spell - was broken by a blast from a sentinel. Amora lost her control over the Red Onslaught, who was soon stopped by a more potent Inversion Spell cast by <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Wanda Maximoff</a> and Doctor Doom.

Here, Amora the Enchantress assisted Loki in attempting to take over Asgard and defeat the Avengers. Loki created a team called the <a href=\"/lethal-legion/4060-42128/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42128\">Lethal Legion</a>, which was made up of himself, Amora, Skurge, Wonder Man, Ultron and the Scarlet Witch (who had mistaken Amora for her mother). When the entire team, minus Loki, attacked the Avengers' mansion, Amora was able to seduce Iron Man and effectively take him out of the battle. When the Lethal Legion was on the verge of defeat, Amora and Wanda were forced to abandon their team in order to escape. Later, Amora used her powers of mystic seduction after kissing Thor and effectively causing him to join with Loki, who had also turned the other Avengers against each other. After a second attempt to defeat the Avengers, Amora easily defeated Hank Pym, although any victory was short lived, as Loki had managed to absorb an abundance of magical energy from a reactor and quickly turned on his teammates. By using Amora, <a href=\"/agatha-harkness/4005-3327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3327\">Agatha Harkness</a> ,and Wanda's vast magical energies, the Heroes were able to deceive Loki by making him believe that Thor was actually Odin. Despite being previously defeated, the Thunder God was able to hold his own, giving the Avengers the time they required to undo Loki's schemes, which caused him to lose his excess power, at which point he was easily defeated.</p><p>Later, during the Onslaught Reborn saga, Enchantress (and the Lethal Legion) ambushed the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"/ant-man/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant Man</a>, the Vision, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/4005-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2469\">Franklin Richards</a> and <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a> (a female version of Captain America's sidekick). The Enchantress and Wanda were quickly dispatched by the Invisible Woman, but were quickly awakened by Loki. Together the two witches took down Ant Man. However, later Amora and the others joined forces with the heroes so that they could defeat <a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a> once and for all.</p><h3>Ultimate</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1243838\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4092071611253\" data-width=\"391\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 391px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1243838\"><img alt=\"Ultimate 1610\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" data-width=\"454\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg 391w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate 1610\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/7884/1243838-prv5014_pg6.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" data-width=\"454\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate 1610</figcaption></figure><p>Amora recently appeared in the <a href=\"/ultimate-universe/4015-40390/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40390\">Ultimate Universe</a> aiding Loki and a team of Asgardians who attempted to take down the <a href=\"/ultimates/4060-40504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">New Ultimates</a>. It is revealed that Amora and Loki were the ones responsible for giving the Ultimate Defenders, including Valkyrie, their new found powers. Amora also played a central role in manipulating <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Carol Danvers</a>, <a href=\"/power-princess/4005-6912/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6912\">Zarda</a> and Valkyrie (whom she gave a new sword) into betraying their teammates Iron Man, Captain America and <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>. It is later discovered that Amora's hypnotic powers worked only through direct eye contact and that Carol Danvers had use night vision lenses to avoid actually being manipulated by the Asgardian Goddess. After Carol freed her teammates and led an assault against the forces of Loki, Amora was shot through the chest by one of Hawkeye's arrows, causing her control over Valkyrie and Zarda to fade. After Amora regained consciousness, she abandoned Loki, warning him that playing with Thor's heart may have been a grave mistake.</p><p>This version of Amora appears to have similar powers to her 616 counter-part, though she is capable of manipulating women just as easily as she does men. However, she does not appear to be in love or obsessed with Thor in this time-line.</p><h2>Appearances in Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><a href=\"/hulk-vs-thor/4025-187/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-187\">Hulk Vs.

Loki then uses the Hulk to battle against Thor before Amora's spell is broken and the Hulk goes on a rampage through Asgard with no one to control him. After he brutally defeats Thor, Amora comes to Thor's rescue when she heals him and admits that she only assisted Loki because Thor had chosen to be with Sif and not her. She then takes Thor to Loki in order to place Bruce Banner back inside the Hulk, however, Loki has already dispatched the mortal. Thor then tells Amora to go to Odin's side with <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a> to protect the leader of Asgard while he sleeps. Amora and Sif share a few insults before the Hulk arrives.

She first appeared in the \"Night in the Sanctorum\" episode, where she used magic to cause \"bad luck\" to the heroes. This caused the <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon</a> to crash into their headquarters, forcing the team to find a new base of operations.

Amora used the Mole Man's monsters by unleashing them on the city in order to draw the heroes out. As the heroes battled the monsters, the Enchantress used a love spell that made the entire Super Hero Squad (with the exception of Iron Man and Hulk who were elsewhere) fall in love with her. Amora later attempted to seduce the Hulk, but he appeared to \"dumb\" to feel love and simply swatted her away. Angered, Amora ordered her seduced heroes to take her to Shield's helicarrier, where she found Mystique fighting with Iron Man as she had failed to seduce him. Screaming Mimi later arrived with the Hulk. Amora attempted to send her enraptured heroes to attack Iron Man and the Hulk until Mimi unleashed a powerful scream which freed all of the heroes from Amora's spell.

As Odin asks what she wants, she merely answers “Thor, of course, but if I can't be happy, at least I can be royal“ and then throws a heart shaped object at the All-Father ,after being hit, Odin declares his love for Amora and asks her hand in marriage, however, Odin's wife, Frigga appears and reminds Odin he is already married, freeing him from Enchantress`s spell, however, his will is soon re-controlled with a second heart. After the marriage, Odin contacts Thor to tell him the ''good news'', however, the God of Thunder realizes there's something wrong and flies off to Asgard.</p><p>Although Amora enjoys being the queen of Asgard, Loki appears and shows her a tablet of rules, which said that ''Should the King marry someone that isn't royal, he is abandoning the throne''. Using this rule, Loki claims he should be the new king of Asgard, but Thor comes in just in time and is chosen as the new king. Angered, Enchantress teleports away with Odin. After some time, she returns and orders Odin to destroy Thor and Loki, so that she may reclaim the throne. However, after a brief fight, Thor manages to free his father from Enchantress`s spell. Returning to his senses, Odin annulled his marriage with Amora and returns to be the king of Asgard, she accepts defeat and teleports away.</p><p>She was voiced by Grey DeLisle.</p><p> </p><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/4075-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-18\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757423\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.56003159557662\" data-width=\"1266\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1266px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757423\"><img alt=\"Enchantress and Skourge\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 1266w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enchantress and Skourge\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 1266w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81965/1757423-enchantress1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enchantress and Skourge</figcaption></figure><p>The Enchantress makes several appearances throughout the series as an antagonist of Thor and the Avengers. She is voiced by <a href=\"/kari-wahlgren/4040-104995/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-104995\">Kari Wahlgren</a>, and is shown to be in league with Loki and The Executioner in various plots to destroy the Avengers and otherwise disrupt Thor's activities on Midgard. She first appears in the episode \"Thor the Mighty,\" assuming human form in order to manipulate Thor into leaving Asgard and attack the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/4060-18519/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18519\">Wrecking Crew</a>.

After the Avengers defeat Malekith, Enchantress manages to overpower Thor, Iron Man and Black Panther and escape to Asgard with the casket in tow. Later she is seen hunting down the masters of evil in revenge for betraying her as well as reclaiming the last rune stone from Baron Zemo which even Loki feared to use. Confronting Zemo he uses it's power to protect himself from her but when her spell backfires both disappear. It is revealed that the stone is connected to musplheim and that it's power broke the seal containing Surtur who captures the enchantress. The final scene shows her screaming in horror as the demons flaming hand closes around her.</p><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/avengers-assemble/4075-19/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-19\">Avengers Assemble</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5904837\" data-ratio=\"0.57798165137615\" data-width=\"872\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 872px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5904837\"><img alt=\"Enchantress in Avengers Assemble\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png 872w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Enchantress in Avengers Assemble\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png 872w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5904837-screen%20shot%202017-06-17%20at%2011.10.02%20pm.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Enchantress in Avengers Assemble</figcaption></figure><p>Enchantress appears in the fourth season, \"Secret Wars,\" as a recurring villain.

He and his older brother <a href=\"../../barney-barton/29-70149/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barney</a> were the target of an abuse from their alcoholic father (Harold) and their mother (Edith) who didn't care. Tragedy, or perhaps poetic justice, struck when both parents died in a car accident caused by Harold's excessive drinking.</p><p>Soon after the accident, Clint and Barney were put into an orphanage. The two escaped soon after, dreaming of a better life. While on the run, the two fell in the company of a traveling circus. Needing food and shelter, Clint and Barney decided to do odd jobs for the performers.</p><p>Two performers, <a href=\"../../jacques-duquesne/29-3795/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swordsman</a> and <a href=\"../../trick-shot/29-7889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trickshot</a>, saw potential in Clint and took him under their wing. Trickshot taught Clint archery while Swordsman taught Clint acrobatics and knife throwing. The duo became heroes to Clint as he began to surpass his masters. Though Swordsman and Trickshot weren't the greatest father figures, they were the best the circus had to offer, or so he thought. While doing an odd job for a performer, Clint overheard that a great sum of money had been stolen from the ringmaster the night before. Clint thought little of this until he saw Swordsman with an very large amount of money and wondered if his hero could have been the thief from the night before. He questioned his mentor and got the answer he was dreading; Swordsman had indeed stolen the money. Swordsman was quick to offer Clint a cut of the stolen cash if he kept his mouth shut, but he refused and was soon chased, beaten and left for dead by Swordsman. Unable to handle the pain he felt, Clint bolted again. Clint was soon contacted by Barney. Disappointed that Clint left the circus and angry that he was alone, Barney lashed out at his brother. Feeling guilty for leaving his brother, Clint reluctantly agreed to return to his old life.</p><p>Clint felt unappreciated and alone at the circus. His act \"The Amazing Hawkeye\" got little attendance. Much to his dismay, his performance was ignored when Iron Man stopped a runaway ride. After seeing <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a> in action, Clint was inspired to use his archery skills to fight crime.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hawkeye was created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../don-heck/26-6609/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don Heck</a>.

Starting out as a B-list Iron Man villain, Hawkeye became cemented in Avengers lore when the hotheaded bowman was selected to join the team as a replacement for Iron Man. Over the years, Hawkeye has been through several major developments such as adopting the Goliath identity, eloping with Mockingbird, leading his own team of Avengers, leading a team of reformed super-villains and dying at the hands of one of his friends. Whether he is acting as Hawkeye, Goliath or Ronin; one thing remains the same: Clint Barton is ready to answer the call of \"Avengers Assemble!\".</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A Brief Life of Crime</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1219596\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.958\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1219596\"><img alt=\"Black Widow and Hawkeye\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Widow and Hawkeye\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/1219596-untitleh.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Widow and Hawkeye</figcaption></figure><p>Hawkeye's first outing was a major failure; after taking down two jewel thieves, the police arriving on the scene thought him to be the thief.

Eventually, Clint would gain respect for Cap and the two would become close friends throughout the years. After Clint left the Black Widow, she began to question her loyalty to her communist bosses. They would kidnap and brainwash her. They gave her one order and that was to destroy the Avengers. So the Widow hires the Swordsman and <a href=\"../../atlas/29-3277/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Man</a> to do just that. They are quickly stopped by <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank Pym</a> in his Goliath persona. All three managed to escape.

He with the Avengers and her with <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shield</a>. Then one day, Hank Pym gathered the team and told them that he's giving up on the Goliath persona and switching to Yellowjacket permanently. Clint began to think of the possibilities, when a distress signal came in and he finds out that the Widow was in trouble with an over-grown monster robot.</p><p>This robot was part of a scheme by <a href=\"../../egghead/29-3797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egghead</a>, <a href=\"../../mad-thinker/29-2131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mad Thinker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../puppet-master/29-3799/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puppet Master.</a> Knowing the only way to save the woman that he loves was to take Pym's growth serum, Clint decides to become <a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a>. Clint saves the day and the girl. Hank Pym approves of Clint being the new Goliath.</p><h3>Surprise Visitor</h3><p>Jarvis escorts Barney Barton a well known rackets-man to the Avengers conference center where they are discussing the threat of Eggheads Space Station Death Ray. Barney announces that he has dire information about the Space Stations location. The Avengers and Barney Barton storm the Station only to be bombarded with Eggbots. Egghead uses the Puppet Master's radioactive dolls of the Avengers, that were made in their last alliance together. Barney was the only one that wasn't affected and hurls his body against the Death Ray. Barney saved the day, but at great cost to himself. Barney Barton gave his life to save the Avengers and the world from the evil genius <a href=\"../../egghead/29-3797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egghead</a> with his twisted plans of greed. Poor Barney died in Clint's arms. At this point, Clint reveals his real name and brief origin to his other teammates. Egghead disgusted over what happened with his Death Ray, blames Hank Pym ( Who he thinks is still Goliath) for his failures through the years. So he hires the Swordsman to bring Pym to him, and the Swordsman does just that. Only that Goliath is now Clint Barton. After a brief scuffle with Egghead and the Swordsman, Clint breaks it up. Both criminals are brought to justice. Sometime later, the Black Widow dumps Clint so she can spend more time as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><h3>The Skrulls</h3><p>Clint receives a distress signal from the Wasp. Clint embarks and flies a quinjet to a remote island in the Arctic Circle. Except that this island is hot and looks like the amazon.

Clint is forced to attack his friends. Ronan has plans to bring Earth and its inhabitants back to the prehistoric age. Captain Mar-Vell and the rest of the Avengers put a stop to him. Upon their return, the Alien Activities Commission demands the Avengers hand over Captain Mar-Vell to them. The Avengers refuse and tell Mar-Vell to go into hiding. The Commission accuses the Avengers of treason. The main core Avengers show up and disband the team. They end-up being <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrulls</a> in disguise. Finding out that the rest of his teammates and Captain Mar-Vell have been captured by the Skrulls, Clint and Rick Jones are trying to talk their way out of a sticky situation with the remaining Skrulls. But, just in the nick of time, Thor, Captain America, Vision and Iron Man show up to rescue them. After a brief set-back with the Inhumans, Clint and the rest of the Avengers head for space. The Avengers attack a Skrull Mothership and find out about a plan to raze the entire planet Earth. Captain America sends Clint on a life and death mission to do whatever it takes to stop the Skrull ship from completing its mission. Clint manages to catch up to the Skrull ship and board it. Clint, who has no more growth serum, uses nothing but his wits and his guts to stop the Skrulls from completing their mission. This required going back to being an archer. Clint managed to destroy the ship and to get on an escape shuttle, but crashes down to Earth.</p><h3>Not You, But Him</h3><p>While back in the fold, Clint gets a new costume but stays as an archer. Clint also starts to have some feelings for the Scarlet Witch. These feelings are not returned due to her feelings for the Vision. Frustrated about the Scarlet Witch and being an Avenger, Clint puts on his old costume and leaves the team. Only to be approached by an extremely tall gentleman named <a href=\"../../imus-champion/29-19952/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imus Champion</a>. This gentleman asks Clint to train him to become an expert with the bow and arrow and he will get paid very well for his time. Clint agrees, but discovers Champion's evil plan to bomb the San Francisco Fault-Line. The Avengers show up to help Clint put a stop to Champion. Clint then goes on leave again.</p><p>He goes to the Black Widow's apartment in an attempt to rekindle their relationship, but finds her with her new partner <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a>. Which leads to Hawkeye and Daredevil coming to blows. The Avengers show up again to plead with Clint about rejoining their ranks, but he refuses.</p><h3>Time Traveler</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1181298\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1157205240175\" data-width=\"916\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 916px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1181298\"><img alt=\"Wild, Wild West!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" data-width=\"860\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg 916w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg 860w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wild, Wild West!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg 916w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/1181298-0028.jpg 860w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\" data-width=\"860\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wild, Wild West!</figcaption></figure><p>Hawkeye then drifts for a time, until <a href=\"../../kang/29-2264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kang</a> the Conqueror traps him in the past.

So some villains arrive to claim the bounty. With help from Trickshot and his then-separated wife Mockingbird, he defeats Crossfire.

Then, the Kree and Shi'ar have a war about territory and the Avengers get involved. Initially, U.S. Agent was one of the Avengers selected to go out in space to stop the conflict while Hawkeye was selected to stay with the \"Earth Force\". Incensed with the decision, Clint felt his experience was enough to allow him to go out in space. He then runs into Hank Pym, who offers his help by reminding Clint of his growth serum. After ingesting the growth serum and having Pym run some tests on him, Clint is able to sway Captain America's decision and is allowed to go out in space.

Clint instead, rescues <a href=\"../../patsy-walker/29-3316/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patsy Walker</a>, but fails to see Mockingbird.

Clint goes and meets Ivan at his hideout and offers to pay the rent for everyone in the building. Ivan refuses and has his men attack Clint. The fight spills onto the street. One of the goon's dog stops him from shooting Clint, and the dog gets thrown into traffic. Clint is able to save the dog and decided to keep him, naming the dog Lucky.

Hawkeye also finds that the Swordsman has trained another protegee of his own. Clint and Kate go to investigate but are both discovered. Clint is captured and is ordered to be executed. Kate rescues Clint by posing as a member of the circus. The Swordsman's protegee arrives, but Clint is able to paralyze him with the last arrow they had.

However, Franklin Richards restored his hearing when Clint returned from the \"Heroes Reborn\" universe.</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Though he has no superpowers, Hawkeye is still a force to be reckoned with. He is in peak physical condition of an ordinary human, possessing exceptional and seemingly inhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, endurance and agility. He is a world class archer, marksman and sharpshooter thanks to advanced training by <a href=\"/trickshot-chisholm/4005-7889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7889\">Trickshot</a> and more training by himself. Hawkeye is also a talented acrobat and gymnast, performing acrobatic maneuvers that an Olympic gold medalist would envy. Clint was an extremely skilled and very dangerous martial artist and swordsman even before his extra-training as an avenger, trained by <a href=\"/swordsman/4005-3795/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3795\">Swordsman</a> who to hold his own and eventually defeating an opponent using his fists or a sword. He has been trained extensively later, in hand-to-hand and weapons combat by Captain America, making him an accomplished and seasoned combatant. Hawkeye is also shown to be a fine leader, strategist, tactician and field commander. As Ronin, Clint also shows that he can use swords and other melee weapons rather effectively with ease, along with being accurate with certain types of guns. Hawkeye's most famous ability, however, is that he's able to hurl or fire projectiles with extreme speed, accuracy and precision. He is also able to fire or throw objects against walls or other obstacles, resulting in complicated rebounding situations. Hawkeye is also known for his utilization of several \"trick arrows\" containing explosives, electrical discharges, nets, etc. As Goliath, Clint used Hank Pym's \"Pym Particles\" to increase his height and strength.

To save Ivan's life, she accepted a place in the Soviet government's covert \"Red Room\" facility. While there, she was bio- and psycho-technologically enhanced - granting her an unusually long lifespan and prolonged youthful appearance. She became one of the special agents known as the Black Widow. While in the program she was trained by the Winter Soldier, and the two became lovers. Each Black Widow was deployed with false memories to help ensure their loyalty. Natasha was given memories of becoming a ballerina but eventually discovered this fact, along with the knowledge that the Red Room is still active as \"2R\".</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Black Widow was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a>, <a href=\"/don-rico/4040-18134/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-18134\">Don Rico</a> and <a href=\"/don-heck/4040-6609/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6609\">Don Heck</a>.

Not much is known about Black Widow's history prior to World War II other than she was born as Natalia Romanova in Stalingrad, Russia to unknown parents. Nazis set fire to the building that Natasha and her parents were living in and her mother threw Natasha out of the window into the arms of a Russian soldier named <a href=\"/ivan-petrovitch/4005-28699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28699\">Ivan Petrovitch</a>, who was serving in the army at the time. Ivan took care of Natasha while she was growing up and later became her chauffeur. After a youth spent traveling through war-torn Europe with Ivan and his company of troops, Natasha was recruited by the Red Room. Her masters there arranged a marriage with the hero pilot <a href=\"/red-guardian/4005-7581/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7581\">Alexei Shostakov</a>, and soon with the help of Red Room brainwashing, Natasha became convinced she was an ordinary Russian housewife. When Alexei was (seemingly) killed, Natasha found she had a deep-rooted desire to serve her country and demanded the government let her serve in his place. She became the KGB's top agent.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Young Natasha</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4594981\" data-ratio=\"1.5328125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4594981\"><img alt=\"Wolverine Training Natasha\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 1252w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 626w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 417w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine Training Natasha\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 1252w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 626w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/4594981-2388688-black_widow___deadly_origin_01_pg_17.jpg 417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine Training Natasha</figcaption></figure><p>For a while, Black Widow was trained and helped by Wolverine, who temporarily left his violent ways for her and cared very much about her well-being.

Natasha was attracted to Tony Stark and decided to try and distract him so that her partner could destroy Stark’s plants. Soon after her partner Boris Turgenov and enemy, Anton Vanko died, Natasha decided to stay in America and act as an undercover spy in order to regain the favor of the K.G.B. She faked sympathy in Tony Stark in order to steal his anti-gravity device. Natasha would be successful in stealing the device and used it to cause destruction.

She would sometimes use Hawkeye as he was attracted to her, and he would help her in some of her missions. Natasha was able to trick Hawkeye into stealing plans from Tony Stark. Hawkeye agreed to her plan and would eventually run into Iron Man. The two fought each other while Natasha watched from far away. However, one of Hawkeye’s arrows was reflected by Iron Man and it flew off and hit Natasha, knocking her unconscious. After she woke up, the K.G.B. gave her orders to stop attacking Stark Industries and gave her a new target, the Williams Innovations. Natasha would again convince Hawkeye somehow into attacking the company.

However, Natasha would somehow convince Hawkeye again into stealing the Stark plans again. While Hawkeye was on the mission, the K.G.B. came and kidnapped Natasha, bringing her back to Russia. They designed a new costume for Natasha and new equipment. Natasha then returned to join Hawkeye in a battle against Iron Man. However, Iron Man would defeat them when he shocks Natasha with an electrical blast.</p><p>However, her attraction towards Hawkeye questioned her loyalty to Russia. Hawkeye refused to work with Black Widow and joined the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>. The K.G.B. once again kidnapped Natasha and brainwashed her into serving them again. They ordered her to attack the Avengers, but she freed herself from their brainwashing and reunited with Hawkeye. She became an ally of the Avengers, aiding them in many missions. However, she was not a full-time member as she did not respect the Avenger’s oath of non-killing.</p><p>Natasha later decided to join <a href=\"/shield/3775/\" data-ref-id=\"3775\">SHIELD</a> to be their double agent and operative against the K.G.B.

She and the Avengers fought Red Guardian and he died in battle.

She told him that she wanted to pursue a solo career and had to break it off with him. She became an all-new Black Widow, changing her costume into an all black color. She became a vigilante and fought against common criminals in New York. Eventually, Natasha would be reunited with Ivan when he comes to America, Ivan served as Natasha’s chauffeur and would occasionally give her advice. While working in New York, Natasha would encounter <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>. The two quickly teamed up and eventually developed a romantic relationship. Natasha’s relationship with <a href=\"/foggy-nelson/4005-3124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3124\">Foggy Nelson</a>, Matt partner, was never good, as he was brainwashed into prosecuting Natasha for the murder of the <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>. Natasha never forgave Foggy for that incident, even though she was proven innocent. Eventually, Matt and Natasha’s relationship would go so far to the point where Matt broke up with <a href=\"/karen-page/4005-4486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4486\">Karen Page</a>. The new couple decided to move to San Francisco to start a new life there. They continued their duo vigilante careers in the streets of San Francisco.</p><p>Natasha would pursue a career outside of crime fighting and would try to become a fashion designer. However, she failed in this endeavor. This did not help her relationship with Matt, which had become a bit shaky. Natasha and Daredevil would later aid the Avengers in a battle against <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, and the two were offered memberships to the Avengers which they accepted. However, Natasha soon realized that she was not a comfortable fit for a team while fighting the Lion God. Natasha quit the Avengers and reconciled with Matt. They continued their relationship for quite some time, but eventually, Natasha would break up with Matt because she felt he did not treat her equally on the battlefield. She would remain friends with Matt and continue to help him on occasion.</p><h3>The Champions</h3><p>She remained on the West Coast and briefly joined and led <a href=\"/champions/4060-40413/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40413\">the Champions</a> of Los Angeles, all the while having a romantic relationship with <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>. The group was funded by <a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> and achieved moderate success, but was eventually broken off due to bankruptcy. Shortly after the Champions had disbanded, Natasha and Hercules answered a summons from their former team the Avengers and aided them in battling the nigh-omnipotent man-god Michael Korvac. Hercules and the Black Widow split up a short time later and Natasha went solo for a while.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2289789-tumblr_ljuljipe391qinctjo1_500.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2289789-tumblr_ljuljipe391qinctjo1_500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2289789-tumblr_ljuljipe391qinctjo1_500.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2289789-tumblr_ljuljipe391qinctjo1_500.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Natasha was still widely known by the criminal underworld as one of Daredevil’s lovers. With this knowledge, <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a> kidnapped Natasha, wanting to use her as bait to lure Daredevil into a trap. Natasha was able to free herself and aided Daredevil in defeating Bullseye. Later, an enemy of Natasha’s named Damon Dran captured Ivan in order to lure Black Widow into his trap. He had an army of female combatants. <a href=\"/damon-dran/4005-32092/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32092\">Damon Dran</a> wanted to send a fake Black Widow to assassinate <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>.

He told Natasha that Matt was very depressed following the death of Elektra, but also alleged that Matt had ruined his fiancee Heather Glenn's career to force her to agree to marry him. The two decided to write forged notes to both Matt and Heather to make them break up (the truth of Heather and Matt's dispute was that Matt stopped Heather's business life after her company was corrupted by Kingpin's cohorts).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4827978\" data-ratio=\"1.4869888475836\" data-width=\"538\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 538px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4827978\"><img alt=\"Black Widow's 80's look\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg 538w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Widow's 80's look\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg 538w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4827978-2076522412-01.ke.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Widow's 80's look</figcaption></figure><p>Natasha then teamed up with Daredevil to stop the Hand who were attempting to revive <a href=\"/elektra/1802/\" data-ref-id=\"1802\">Elektra</a> to serve as their new champion.

Natasha however, knew that Elektra had been successfully revived, but she kept this information from Daredevil for his own good.</p><p>Heather Glenn was so upset by the break up that she committed suicide. This made Natasha partly responsible for her death. Russian agents duped Natasha into doing their dirty work by building a model of Alexei Shostakov called a <a href=\"/life-model-decoy/4055-42286/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42286\">Life Model Decoy</a> (LMD). They threatened to kill \"Alexei\" if she did not participate in their plans. When Natasha got what they needed, they revealed the truth and tried to kill her but she defeated them with Ivan’s help. Natasha's brain was then reprogrammed into an agent called \"Oktober\" launching missiles to ignite World War III. Natasha was successful in launching the missiles. Iron Man, however, stopped the missiles from detonating and helped her capture the K.G.B. agent responsible for the reprogramming.</p><h3>Joining the Avengers</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2299579-hercules___90_s_look_charging_w_avengers_panel_color_5x_lrg.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2299579-hercules___90_s_look_charging_w_avengers_panel_color_5x_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2299579-hercules___90_s_look_charging_w_avengers_panel_color_5x_lrg.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2299579-hercules___90_s_look_charging_w_avengers_panel_color_5x_lrg.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Natasha returned to the Avengers and even though <a href=\"/black-knight/3172/\" data-ref-id=\"3172\">Black Knight</a> was the leader on the field, she was leader in managing the team's plans.

She is accused of assassinating US senator Whit Crane. The senator's son, Nick, is captured by a rival spy <a href=\"/fatale/4005-74635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74635\">Fatale</a>, who wants to know his source for implicating Natasha. Natasha steals Nick away from her and takes him to a secret CIA base to scare him into giving her his source instead. The plan backfires when both of them are attacked. Natasha and Nick escape, but while in Poland they are attacked by <a href=\"/fantasma/4005-28670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28670\">Fantasma</a> and <a href=\"/crimson-dynamo/4005-7234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7234\">Crimson Dynamo</a>. Natasha takes down Crimson Dynamo, but then Fatale shows up and knocks out Fantasma. Fatale reveals that she was hired to kill Whit Crane but found he had already taken his own life and she needed to use Nick to track down who had actually paid for the hit. Nick gives them the name of a source 'Sadko' (not his true source of info), but when they arrive it's a trap wired with explosives and the two spies are forced to escape. The conspiracy against spies turns out to be wider and Natasha encounters <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a> and Hawkeye on the same trail in Russia where they find many trainee spies and a SHIELD agent have been killed. <a href=\"/perun/4005-26401/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26401\">Perun</a>, Crimson Dynamo, Fantasma and <a href=\"/vostok/4005-28669/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28669\">Sputnik</a> show up to apprehend Hawkeye, believing him to be the Ronin behind the spy deaths.

Dominic and Mockingbird discover an amassing battle force on the Russian coast near to the northern Japanese islands, while Natasha and Hawkeye track down 'the Madame' - an old Ninja working with the new Ronin to bring about this Russian attack. The four heroes meet up on the disputed island 'Iturup' where they meet the Ronin, who is revealed as Alexi Shostakov. His plan was to kill off world intelligence operatives leaving countries blind while he made his attack, and bring the four heroes to him so he could kill them. Shostakov sets off the volcano on the island, but Natasha and the others use the lava to defeat his forces. He is defeated when Natasha shows Fantasma his true plan and Fantasma then hypnotizes him into seeing Natasha's death, allowing the real Natasha to take him down.</p><h3>The Longest Winter</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2288329\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2288329\"><img alt=\"The Longest Winter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 631w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Longest Winter\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 631w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2288329-scan10073_2.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Longest Winter</figcaption></figure><p>Natasha and Bucky were looking for a sleeper agent of the Zephyr project, in a stasis container at a Vegas casino and when they got there they realized the agent had been awakened.

This gave her physical abilities much like Captain America, though not as great as his. She possesses peak-level physiology, making her as strong, agile, fast, and durable as a female human can possibly be without being classified as superhuman. This also extends to her senses and immune system, which are similarly heightened to peak human level. From a young age, Natasha was trained to become a martial artist the martial arts she knows are karate, judo, kenpo, jujutsu, ninjutsu, aikido, savate, Muay Thai, Sambo and multiple styles of kung fu sharpshooter and acrobat, and has become a master of all of these skills. She has since become one of the top espionage operatives in the world. Natasha has also proven herself to be one of the best information gatherers in the Marvel Universe. She is fluent in many different languages and is an expert computer programmer and hacker. She is an accomplished battle strategist and field commander, and has been the leader of the Avengers and even SHIELD on one occasion.</p><p>In the 2004 Black Widow mini-series, Natasha's background was retconned. She was subjected to biotechnological and psycho-technological enhancement. This answers the question as to why Natasha is still so youthful despite being born prior to World War II.</p><h3>Paraphernalia</h3><p>Despite its skin-tight appearance, the black catsuit that Natasha wears is made of a high-tech synthetic fabric that is resistant to high temperatures and even small-arms fire. It is further enhanced with tiny suction cups that allow her to cling to walls and even ceilings, much like her black widow spider namesake. She carries state-of-the-art versions of gear used by top modern spies, including stunners, tear-gas, a cable and a transmitter. Natasha can quickly travel across rooftops and from building to building with a grappling hook and a retractable line called the Widow's Line. She also carries various types of weapons, ranging from melee to long distance. Her primary weapon is the 'Widow's Bite,' which is delivered via her wrist cartridges.

Eventually, Natasha would be promoted to public status on the Ultimates when a suitable background was written for her. She teamed with other heroes such as Captain America, Iron Man, <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a>, Giant-Man ( <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank Pym</a>), <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thor</a>, and others. Natasha's skills were genetically enhanced when she was a part of the K.G.B., allowing her to coordinate battles far better than those of human level. Natasha would later develop a romantic relationship with Tony Stark and they got engaged. He even created an Iron Man armor for Natasha as engagement present and nanites that were bonded to her skin to control the armor. However, unknown to Natasha, the suit injected her with nanites that would short-circuit her brain. When trying to capture Thor, Natasha pretended that she was pregnant to trick him. Natasha would eventually reveal to Tony that she was a traitor and reveals that she was the one responsible for making the knowledge of Bruce Banner being the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> public, framing Thor and Captain America, and the invasion of America by the Liberators. Natasha was also responsible for the death of Hawkeye's family.</p><p>After Tony gained all the information, he activated the nanites in her brain, causing her to go unconscious. After the Ultimates were able to stop the invasion, Natasha was in the hospital from loss of blood. Hawkeye comes in and reveals that she cut her own wrist to get medical attention. Hawkeye pins Natasha to the wall with his arrows, then he shoots one last arrow in between her eyes, killing her.</p><h4>X-Men: Forever</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4595041\" data-ratio=\"1.4567474048443\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4595041\"><img alt=\"Black Widow in X-men Forever\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Widow in X-men Forever\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/4595041-bw.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Widow in X-men Forever</figcaption></figure><p>Black Widow appeared in the Volume 2 series and appeared in issues #11,#12,#13 and #14.

Avengers</a> </i>and <a href=\"/ultimate-avengers-2/4025-151/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-151\"><i>Ultimate Avengers 2</i></a>, voiced by Olivia D'Abo. Natalia Romanova is a SHIELD agent and Fury's Number One. In the films, Natalia develops a mutual attraction to Captain America, that, by the end of the second film, becomes a committed romantic relationship between the two. She is also friends with Betty Ross and Janet Van Dyne (aka The Wasp).</p><p>In the first film, she is - outside of Captain America - the only member of the Ultimate Avengers not to be fired after the failure of their first mission. She is later seen defending the Triskelion alongside Nick Fury during the Chitauri Invasion. Black Widow also tranquilizes the Hulk after he rampages and attacks the Avengers, in order to help calm him down. She also participates in defending Wakanda from the second Chitauri Invasion in the sequel.</p><p>In the films, Natalia shows no sign of the super soldier serum and her age isn't defined. She is an expert marksman and hand-to-hand combatant. In the battles against the Hulk and the Chitauri, she utilizes various weapons made of Vibranium. In the film, she also speaks with a thick Russian Accent.</p><h4>Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow (2007)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3525949\" data-ratio=\"0.55833333333333\" data-width=\"720\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3525949\"><img alt=\"Next Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Next Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 720w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/14/148344/3525949-cap_widow_naht.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Next Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Black Widow is briefly mentioned in the Marvel Animation film, <a href=\"/next-avengers-heroes-of-tomorrow/4025-527/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-527\"><i>Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow</i></a>, as the mother of <a href=\"/james-rogers/4005-71159/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71159\">James Rogers</a>; the son of Captain America.

Although deeply loved by his mother, Bruce’s father who was mentally unstable harbored a deep jealousy and hatred for him. Brian was convinced that his work in atomic science had altered his genetic structure and because of this he also feared that Bruce would grow up a genetic freak, when actually, Bruce was just a very gifted and intelligent child. While growing up Bruce was subjected to Brian’s drunken rages and abuse, as was his mother. Tragically, Rebecca was killed by Brian when she attempted to take young Bruce and leave him. His mother's murder and his father's arrest left Bruce in the care of his aunt, Mrs. Drake, and he grew up a social outcast due to the trauma of being abused by his father as well as witnessing his mother’s abuse and murder at the hands of his father.</p><p>After graduating high school, Bruce began studying nuclear physics at Desert State University and later at the California Institute of Technology. He gained employment with the military at Desert Base, New Mexico under the command of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General “Thunderbolt” Ross</a>, who was overseeing the test of Banner’s newly-created <a href=\"/gamma-bomb/4055-55673/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55673\">Gamma Bomb</a>. It was here that he met Ross’s daughter, <a href=\"/betty-ross/4005-3445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3445\">Betty</a> and the two found a mutual attraction. On the day of the bomb’s scheduled detonation Banner saw someone in the testing area. Hoping to rescue this person, Banner went into the testing area where he encountered the person he'd seen; a young teenager named <a href=\"/rick-jones/4005-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2248\">Rick Jones</a>, who had sneaked onto the test site on a dare. Banner managed to push Jones to safety. However, rather than delay the countdown and halt the detonation as instructed, Banner’s assistant Igor Starsky, (in reality, a foreign secret agent named <a href=\"/igor-drenkov/4005-27723/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27723\">Igor Drenkov</a>) allowed the countdown and the subsequent detonation to occur. This resulted in Banner being caught in the Gamma Bomb explosion and thus exposed to an incredibly massive amount of gamma radiation. Banner and Jones were later picked up by the base's military personnel and taken back to Desert Base where they were placed in isolation and observation due to their exposure to gamma radiation. They were still in isolation at sundown when Banner transformed into a gray, monstrous, and lumbering brute for the first time. This brute was quickly dubbed “the Hulk” by military personnel.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The character of the Hulk was created by artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> and writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and first appearing in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-incredible-hulk-1-the-coming-of-the-hulk/4000-5883/\">The Incredible Hulk #1</a> (May 1962). When creating the Hulk, Lee and Kirby were inspired by the horror/literature characters <a href=\"/frankensteins-monster/4005-38840/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38840\">Frankenstein</a> and <a href=\"/dr-jekyllmr-hyde/4005-22215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22215\">Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde</a>. The Hulk has seen many writers at the helm, notably Lee himself and greats such as <a href=\"/bill-mantlo/4040-42478/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42478\">Bill Mantlo</a>, <a href=\"/peter-david/4040-40682/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40682\">Peter David</a> and <a href=\"/greg-pak/4040-42041/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42041\">Greg Pak</a>. Notable artists include Kirby, <a href=\"/marie-severin/4040-3492/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3492\">Marie Severin</a>, <a href=\"/herb-trimpe/4040-3439/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3439\">Herb Trimpe</a>, <a href=\"/sal-buscema/4040-12717/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-12717\">Sal Buscema</a>, <a href=\"/john-byrne/4040-1770/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1770\">John Byrne</a>, <a href=\"/todd-mcfarlane/4040-3380/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-3380\">Todd McFarlane</a>, <a href=\"/dale-keown/4040-1827/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1827\">Dale Keown</a>, <a href=\"/gary-frank/4040-1824/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1824\">Gary Frank</a>, <a href=\"/adam-kubert/4040-10434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10434\">Adam Kubert</a>, <a href=\"/mike-deodato-jr/4040-21341/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-21341\">Mike Deodato, Jr.</a>, and <a href=\"/john-romita-jr/4040-13709/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-13709\">John Romita Jr</a>.</p><p>Lee originally intended the Hulk to be colored gray, believing that \"gray would be a heavy, dramatic, somber color, in keeping with the melodramatic mood we wanted to establish.\" However, initial copies of the first issue showed that the printers had a difficult time maintaining the gray color, and the decision was made to change his skin to the more familiar green. Until 1986, any and all reprints featuring the origin story would depict the Hulk with green skin until writer/artist John Byrne would incorporate the original gray coloring into canon in <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk-baptism-of-fire/4000-26700/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-26700\">The Incredible Hulk #318</a>.</p><p>Bruce Banner was originally meant to be his real name until the name was written as Bob in few comics. To amend this, his name became Robert Bruce Banner and he went by his middle name.</p><h2><b>Character Evolution</b></h2><h3><b>Silver Age</b></h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417734-avengers_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2417734\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.496583143508\" data-width=\"439\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 439px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417734-avengers_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2417734\"><img alt=\"Hulk during the Silver age with the Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2417734-avengers_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417734-avengers_1.jpg 439w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2417734-avengers_1.jpg 427w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" data-width=\"427\"></a><figcaption>Hulk during the Silver age with the Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>(1962-1970)</p><p>While the Hulk’s original series failed to last more than six issues, writer Stan Lee felt that the Hulk would work best as a reoccurring character in other titles, and finally settled on the Hulk being a co-founder of the Avengers. By the next issue, he wrote the character off the team, and delegated him as a reoccurring menace until he was given co-billing in the <i>Tales to Astonish</i> title alongside <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Giant-Man</a> and the <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>. Featuring the art talents of Steve Ditko, Jack Kirby, Bob Powell, John Romita Sr., Bill Everett, John Buscema, Gil Kane, Marie Severin, and finally Herb Trimpe, the Hulk’s popularity continued to soar until taking over the title completely with issue #102 in 1968. Roy Thomas soon took over writing chores for Lee and Herb Trimpe settled in as regular penciler for the next eight years.</p><h3><b>Bronze Age</b></h3><p>(1970-1985)</p><p>Thomas and Trimpe continued as the regular creative team for the title until Thomas accepted the role of Editor-In-Chief in 1972. Top writers of the era such as Gerry Conway, Steve Gerber, Archie Goodwin, Steve Englehart rotated through various stints until Len Wein settled in as regular writer with <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk-re-enter-the-missing-link/4000-14584/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-14584\">The Incredible Hulk #179</a> . Wein’s run is most notable for the introduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> in <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk-and-nowthe-wolverine/4000-14760/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-14760\">The Incredible Hulk #181</a> . Artist Herb Trimpe moved on to other assignments in 1975, allowing Sal Buscema to take over for the next decade (starting with issue #194 and ending with #309, taking very few breaks along the way.) Roger Stern took over for Wein, who began to delve into the psychological aspect of the Hulk (most prominent during the Peter David run.) Bill Mantlo took over for Stern and embarked on a six year stint that saw the Hulk and his supporting cast grow and change in numerous ways. In 1982, Mantlo had Bruce Banner take control of the Hulk’s body, gain world-wide acceptance and then descend into mindless madness before handing the book over to John Byrne, who separated Banner and the Hulk and married off Bruce and Betty.</p><h3><b>Modern Age</b></h3><p>(1985-present)</p><p>Al Milgrom stepped in briefly after Byrne left, and changed the Hulk back to his original gray-skinned form, paving the way for Peter David to take over in 1987. Paired with such artists as Todd McFarlane and Jeff Purves, David continued chronicling the gray Hulk and later had him adopt the identity of “Joe Fixit”, a Las Vegas leg-breaker. David continued as writer for the next several years, as he paired with Dale Keown and merged the green and gray Hulk personalities with Banner’s, creating a new Hulk incarnation. From there, the character continued to progress, regress and change in various ways until David left the title in 1997. Joe Casey replaced David until the title was relaunched under a new name “Hulk” under writer John Byrne and artist Ron Garney. Byrne soon left and the title returned to its original heading of the “Incredible Hulk” with Paul Jenkins at the helm until Bruce Jones took over in 2002. The next several years saw the Hulk and Banner on the run from a mysterious agency that was later revealed to be led by long-time Hulk nemesis the Leader. Taking over from Jones was writer Greg Pak, who began with the “Planet Hulk” story-line that saw the Hulk banished to another world by other super heroes and returning for revenge in “World War Hulk”. The title was soon cancelled and given to Hercules, rebooted as “Hulk” under writer Jeph Loeb and featured a new story and focused on the mysterious Red Hulk for the next two years. The title was again returned under its original numbering and continued after the mystery of the Red Hulk was revealed and re-named “Incredible Hulks”, featuring all the gamma related characters from the last several years. The title was cancelled as Greg Pak left to other projects and relaunched again as \"The Incredible Hulk\" with incoming writer Jason Aaron and artist Marc Silvestri.</p><h3>Marvel NOW!</h3><p>After Aaron, <a href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid</a> and <a href=\"/leinil-francis-yu/4040-6314/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-6314\">Leinil Yu</a> have taken on the Hulk with the new relaunched Hulk title called <a href=\"/indestructible-hulk/4050-54112/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-54112\">Indestructible Hulk</a> beginning in November 2012. The premise of this series is that Bruce Banner has finally accepted he will never be rid of The Hulk and decided it's time he used his genius for the good of mankind - and get the recognition he deserves. Thus Dr. Banner has decided to become an agent of <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, allowing them to use Hulk as a weapon of mass destruction in exchange for providing Banner with the funds, lab, equipment and staff he needs to create his inventions.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Beginnings for the Hulk</h3><p>After absorbing the radiation from a gamma bomb explosion, Bruce Banner became a giant, grey version of the Hulk at night (he would not transform into the subsequently-standard green Hulk until much later). Banner's first adventure was when he was captured by the Russian villain, <a href=\"/gargoyle/4005-7114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7114\">The Gargoyle</a>, whom Igor Drenkov/Starsky, a communist spy who was working undercover as a scientist with Bruce Banner, had informed of Banner's transformation. The Gargoyle wanted to know the secret of the Hulk so he could reverse his own horrible radiation-damaged face. In return for Banner's help, he released both Banner and Rick Jones, having kidnapped the latter in an effort to force Banner to cooperate. Jones would soon become Bruce's sidekick, travelling with him and attempting to control the Hulk's rage. Because of Banner's lack of control over the Hulk, he was declared a menace by <a href=\"/thaddeus-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross</a>, who mobilized Army personnel under his command to track down the Hulk under orders to capture him -- and to destroy him if at all possible. However, Banner would gain some control over the Hulk with radiation treatments and become a founding member of the Avengers. However this would not last long and misunderstandings with team members led to The Hulk leaving The Avengers. Banner regained the ability to conceal his condition for some time, but that would not last and he commenced to wander the country as both Banner and the Hulk.</p><h3>A Rogues Gallary</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2417715\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2417715\"><img alt=\"Hulk and the Silver Surfer\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk and the Silver Surfer\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2417715-tta_93.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk and the Silver Surfer</figcaption></figure><p>The Hulk would battle many foes over the years such as <a href=\"/leader/4005-7617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7617\">The Leader</a>, <a href=\"/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\">Abomination</a>, <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"/absorbing-man/4005-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1779\">Absorbing Man</a>, and <a href=\"/wendigo/4005-13313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13313\">The Wendigo</a>.

In one notable encounter, The Hulk teamed up with fellow <a href=\"/antiheroes/4015-55830/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55830\">anti-hero</a> <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor The Sub-Mariner</a> to battle The Avengers (Avengers #3, January 1964). However Hulk soon lost interest and abandoned the Prince of <a href=\"/atlantis/4020-41030/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41030\">Atlantis</a> to fight Earth’s Mightiest Heroes on his own. The conclusion of this tale led to The Avengers discovering the frozen WW2 hero <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>.</p><p>During Banner's wanderings, he paid a visit to his cousin Jennifer Walters, a lawyer in Los Angeles. But in the course of their visit, she was shot by a henchman of the crime boss <a href=\"/nick-trask/4005-33847/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33847\">Nicholas</a> <a href=\"/trask/4005-6053/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6053\">Trask</a> for defending a thug of his, Lou Monkton, whom he was framing for murder. All Banner could do to save his cousin was give her a blood transfusion. Because of this, she was turned into the heroine, the <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a>. Soon after, the Hulk was captured by Dr. Leonard Samson ( <a href=\"/doc-samson/4005-4315/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4315\">Doc Samson</a>), and the two discovered that the only way to cure Banner of being the Hulk was that the two would have to separate their bodies. Banner was placed in a 'nutrient bath' that separated the cells that were uniquely his from those of the irradiated Hulk. Being separate, they each gained their own body and personalities, but the Hulk becomes an even greater threat without Banner's mental and moral restraint. Banner would soon create a team called \"The Hulk-Busters\" to track down and stop the Hulk. Banner soon chose this time to ask Betty Ross to marry him.</p><h3>Wedding of Bruce and Betty</h3><p>During the wedding Banner became sick. It was revealed that Banner and The Hulk needed each other or they would die as they were losing their molecular cohesion. After being weakened by his sickness, the Hulk was captured by the Avengers. Accepting that the only way to stop the Hulk and save her husband, Betty asks the Avengers to spare the Hulk. With some help from \"The <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>,\" a synthezoid that was one of the Avengers's greatest enemies, the robot Ultron (created by Henry Pym) from the remains of the original Human Torch, the two were re-joined together. Unfortunately, without The Vision's presence, the cohesion remained unstable. Banner slipped into a coma and the Hulk was restrained. Dr. Samson decide that the only way to re-combine the two was to place them back into the 'nutrient bath' with reversed ionization. As they were preparing for the process, Banner and the Hulk, now restrained in the gamma base, begin transforming back and forth; Hulk to Banner and back again, arguing the whole time over who would control their body. Oddly, Banner began to push out from within the Hulk's body, asking Samson and the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> agents present to kill him and stop the Hulk permanently. Refusing to harm Banner, the SHIELD agents corralled the Hulk back into the 'bath'. General Ross escaped his SHIELD escort during that time and attempted to ruin the 'bath' in hopes of permanently destroying the Hulk, but he was impeded by Rick Jones, who ended up being pushed into the nutrient bath himself. When the tank eventually ruptured, the Grey Hulk emerged, to the shock of everyone present.</p><p>At this time Banner would turn into the Hulk at nightfall and return to human form during the day. As the two traded off, each would try to find a way to destroy the other. For a time, Jones became a Hulk-like creature himself, but he was soon cured by the Leader. However, the process established a mental link between the two. General Ross was killed at this approximate time, but his body was stolen by the Leader, who afterwards kidnapped Betty Ross Banner. Bruce Banner, Jones, and <a href=\"/clay-quartermain/4005-7524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7524\">Clay Quartermain</a> set out to try and save her and destroy all of the remaining gamma bombs in the possession of the government and thereby foil the Leader's plans to steal them. To slow down the Hulk's search for him, the Leader returned Betty, and she revealed that she was pregnant. The Leader did succeed, in spite of Banner's, Jones's, and Quartermain's efforts, in stealing a gamma bomb, which he detonated in a small Arizona town called Middletown. It seemingly killed the Hulk and created several new gamma irradiated servants for the Leader, whom he nicknamed <a href=\"/samuel-j-laroquette/4005-30871/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30871\">Rock</a>, <a href=\"/hotshot/4005-10867/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10867\">Hotshot</a>, <a href=\"/jailbait/4005-10868/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10868\">Jailbait</a> and <a href=\"/ogress/4005-25211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25211\">Ogress</a>.

Mr. Fixit. This incarnation of the Hulk was a mean-spirited, street smart, wise-cracking thug. He became a \"leg-breaker\" for <a href=\"/michael-berengetti/4005-29214/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29214\">Michael Berengetti</a> at his casino. Under the persona of Joe Fixit he had everything he wanted: women, money and peace, since the world believed that the Hulk had died in the gamma bomb explosion. He also started a relationship with <a href=\"/marlo-jones/4005-10860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10860\">Marlo Jones</a>. Marlo would soon leave him and began dating Rick Jones, whom she later married.

As payment for helping, they placed a spell on Fixit that they promised would rid him of Banner permanently. This spell is somehow altered by his abrupt return and only lasted three months. When Banner surfaced again, he is amazed that three months had passed since he had been himself. After some confusing encounters, he came to understand what Joe had done in his time and creates a shaky truce with his alternate personality.</p><h3>Evolutionary War</h3><p><b>For more information see:</b> <a href=\"/evolutionary-war/4045-42181/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42181\">Evolutionary War</a></p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021145\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5456790123457\" data-width=\"405\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 405px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2021145\"><img alt=\"Evolutionary War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg 405w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Evolutionary War\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/10/101073/2021145-181988_10150103407343856_829193855_6218970_1309909_n.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Evolutionary War</figcaption></figure><p>After a battle with the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a>, Fixit was approached by <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> and invited to rejoin the Avengers.

Upon breaking free, the Avengers broke free and decided to use the H.E.'s machinery to \"evolve\" Hercules so that he would be an equal match for their enemy. Upon learning of the plan, Fixit turned on the Avengers wanting to be the one to undergo the process so he could be even stronger. Attacking the team, Captain America decided to alert the H.E. to their presence in the hope that he would arrive to stop Fixit's plan.</p><p>After the H.E. appeared, he blasted Fixit with a plasmatic beam that would render a normal person into nothing more than their component electric charges. Barely even phased, Fixit was ready to smash H.E. until the villain decided attempting to fight Fixit would only hinder him and instead used his powers to transport him away to the outskirts of Las Vegas. The rest of the Avengers managed to defeat H.E. without Fixit's help as Fixit went back to work for Berengetti and the Avengers, true to their word, left him alone despite his attempt to betray them.</p><h3>Atlantis Attacks</h3><p><b>For more information see:</b> <a href=\"/atlantis-attacks/4045-42182/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42182\">Atlantis Attacks</a></p><p>After wrestling a whale while investigating a sea-park that owed Berengetti money, Fixit began aware of odd happenings involving sea creatures - part of Atlantis' planned invasion of the surface world. Fixit rejoined the Avengers to help them battle against invading Atlanteans but again left the team immediately after the conflict.</p><h3>Countdown</h3><p>Under the false identity of Bruce 'Bancroft', Banner takes a job as a janitor at the Yucca Flats Nuclear Research Center so that he could still look for a cure for the Hulk. He is poisoned by <a href=\"/mad-man/4005-50983/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50983\">Madman</a> just moments before the Research Center is attacked by the Abomination and Hulk is shocked when he realized that his healing factor wasn't strong enough to fight off the poison. He struggles against the <a href=\"/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\">Abomination</a>, but eventually throws him into a barrel of toxic waste which permanently scars him. Even in the form of the Hulk, the pain of the poison continues, giving him multiple heart attacks. During this time, Hulk fights the <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/4005-20604/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20604\">She-Thing</a> while searching for <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a>' help in curing him. Reed can not find a cure, and estimates that upon his transformation at next daybreak, Banner would not be able to survive the condition.</p><p>In the form of Joe Fixit, the Hulk begins to waste away, losing most of his body mass and strength. The Leader offers his assistance in finding an antidote if Hulk promises to kill his brother, Madman. After finding Madman and infecting him during the fight, Fixit was able to grab the antidote but could not pierce his skin with the needle. At the moment of his transformation, Banner is able to administer the serum, saving himself, but he left Madman beaten and unable to reach the antidote himself. At this time, Banner believes that Betty has had his child and goes on a desperate search to find her (not knowing that she had miscarried), even enlisting the help of <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>. Stark had found out about the miscarriage but did not have the heart to tell Bruce.</p><h3>Professor Hulk</h3><p>Later, with help from Samson and the <a href=\"/ringmaster/4005-3803/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3803\">Ringmaster</a>'s hypnosis, Banner confronts his other sides as well as two other personalities called Guilt Hulk and Devil Hulk, whom represented Banner's guilt over his family and Banner's hatred of the world. This doesn't actually make him physically change into either of these personalities but Banner was soon able to gain control, and, after speaking with a manifestation of his deceased mother, created a merged form, sometimes referred to as the Professor. This Hulk was green and as strong the Green Hulk during his rage. The drawback to this version of the Hulk was that when he got too angry and lost control he reverted back to the body of Bruce Banner with the intelligence of the savage Hulk.</p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet</h3><p><b>For more information see:</b> <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4045-42233/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42233\">Infinity Gauntlet</a></p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2928152\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.50793650793651\" data-width=\"756\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 756px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2928152\"><img alt=\"Hulk races for the Gauntlet\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 756w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk races for the Gauntlet\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 756w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2928152-the_infinity_gauntlet__6___page_24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk races for the Gauntlet</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos the Mad Titan</a> acquired the reality warping and wish fulfilling <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, he wished half of all living beings on Earth be turned to dust. Scrambling to oppose the near omnipotent villain, the Avengers invited Hulk back onto the team to aid them in their attempts to thwart Thanos' plans. Despite some tension between Hulk and the team, the new more intelligent Hulk managed to accept his place within the team.</p><p>The Avengers, and an assortment of other heroes, launched an attack on Thanos which ultimately failed with most of the heroes being defeated, destroyed or wiped off the face of the Earth entirely.

As a favor to their friend <a href=\"/jim-wilson/4005-3479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3479\">Jim Wilson</a>, Hulk and Rick agreed to help out at an AIDS benefit concert with Rick headlining and Hulk providing security. The concert is disrupted by the drug-addicted assassin, <a href=\"/speedfreek/4005-25735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25735\">Speedfreek</a> who is sent to kill one of the concert's attendees. Jim was stabbed while defending the man, and the Hulk gets rid of Speedfreek before he could kill anybody. When Hulk and Rick return to the Pantheon they are sent to the Florida Everglades to investigate the disappearance of two teens that may have been tied to a missing Pantheon scientist. While there they battle both the Man-Thing and the missing scientist who had transformed himself into the <a href=\"/glob/4005-3474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3474\">Glob</a>, who was killed by the touch of the <a href=\"/man-thing/4005-4988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4988\">Man-Thing.</a> During one of his missions with them he fights alongside a rebel force in a Trans-Sabal against both S.H.I.E.L.D. issue <a href=\"/mandroids/4005-9665/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9665\">Mandroids</a> and the new government super team, <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a>. The country was being ruled by Farnoq Dahn, a dictator who had promised the US government energy assistance if they helped him keep his place as unchallenged ruler. He was exposed as a psycho when he tries to win the war by tying a mother and child to two separate missiles, threatening to launch them if the Pantheon didn't stop. He is stopped by Hulk and X-Factor. The tyrant is forced to face his people for the crimes he committed but most of them still saw him as a god and bowed at his feet, he was then shot and killed by a traumatized Rick Jones who had taken a <a href=\"/mandroid/4005-13920/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13920\">Mandroid</a> suit.</p><p>The Hulk uses his Pantheon resources to confront Igor, his former assistant who let the gamma bomb go off that created the Hulk. Igor has been driven insane by nightmares brought on by his decision to let the bomb detonate. On her way back from a mission, one of the Pantheon members, <a href=\"/atalanta/4005-20607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20607\">Atalanta</a>, is shot down in the Himalayas by the Troyjan warrior <a href=\"/trauma/4005-26469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26469\">Trauma</a> and Hulk, <a href=\"/ulysses/4005-11618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11618\">Ulysses</a>, and <a href=\"/hector/4005-9409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9409\">Hector</a> were sent to find her. Hulk finds Trauma's ship and is ambushed and left for dead. Trauma finds Atlanta and confesses his love to her, but the Hulk appears and brings down an avalanche on top of him. When Hulk's old boss, Michael Berengetti is killed, Hulk teams up with the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> to get revenge on his killer and his super-powered enforcer, Frost.</p><h3>The End of a Great Leader?</h3><p>During this time Marlo was killed by a woman posing as Rick's mother. But because of the extreme emotional pain that Rick was feeling, the <a href=\"/leader/4005-7617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7617\">Leader</a> also felt it because of their mental bond. It was causing him an extreme annoyance, so he offered to bring her back to life. Leader attacked the Pantheon's headquarters, The Mount, using both his gamma soldiers and the <a href=\"/u-foes/4060-3238/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3238\">U-Foes</a> to distract the Hulk so that he could ask Agamemnon for help against <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">Hydra</a>. Agamemnon agreed to help and the Hulk left in anger. Betty went to find him and they finally began to reconnect, but Agamemnon betrayed the Leader by sending the Hulk to Freehold in order to kill him. The Hulk crashed into Freehold during the middle of the Hydra invasion as the Leader was trying to resurrect Marlo. Overcome with anger, Hulk ignored Rick's pleas to stop, and destroyed the machine because he thought that the Leader was lying and taking advantage of his grieving friend. The Leader was seemingly killed in the battle against the Hulk and it was during this battle that Hulk knocked the helmet off of Redeemer. This revealed the resurrected General Ross.</p><h3>Leader of the Pantheon</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6933933\" data-ratio=\"1.5366666666667\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6933933\"><img alt=\"The Professor goes to war\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 1200w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Professor goes to war\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 1200w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6933933-trans-sabal.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Professor goes to war</figcaption></figure><p>Hulk joined the <a href=\"/pantheon/4060-20605/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-20605\">Pantheon</a>.

As a favor to a former Pantheon member Perseus, Hulk traveled to Lock Ness to investigate reports of a monster in the lake which turned out to be Piecemeal. The Hulk was about to defeat him when Madman interfered. After Perseus was killed, Hulk killed Piecemeal and appeared to kill Madman but no body was found.

With the help of the Silver Surfer and the Starjammers, the Hulk and the Pantheon attacked the Troyjan home world. Upon arriving they were all shocked when Trauma's father, the Troyjan leader, Lord Armageddon, told them the truth about Agamemnon. If they tried to take Atalanta back then the Troyjans would take back the extended lives of all of the Pantheon. Hulk didn't care about the deal and attacked Trauma, accidentally impaling Trauma on his own shoulder spike.

Maestro was a tyrant who ruled his people with the fear of death to anyone who stepped out of line. He had the intelligence of Banner and was twice as strong as the Hulk, also possessing the Hulk's more malevolent side. Merged Hulk went with Janis and met the future Rick, who was stuck in a wheel-chair. Rick had collected the remains of all the deceased heroes while leading the resistance. Hulk fought Maestro, but easily had his neck broken. Maestro then had his servants nurse the Hulk back to health. During their second battle, Maestro used a gun designed by <a href=\"/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a> with the specific purpose of killing the Hulk. He didn't succeed though, and Hulk sent him back in time to ground zero at the moment the gamma bomb that created him went off. After killing Maestro, the Hulk was sent back to the present. When he returned he was haunted by the thought of losing control and becoming Maestro.</p><h3>Fall of the Pantheon</h3><p>Soon after, Rick and Marlo were married. At the wedding, Betty told Hulk that she wants to move into the Mount to be with him.

Hulk refused to fight because of how well his relationship with Betty was going and he didn't want to risk losing his temper again.</p><h3>Brain Damage</h3><p>One day while the Hulk was at work, the army showed up at his house and captured Betty. The squad was led by Glenn Talbot's nephew <a href=\"/matt-talbot/4005-24834/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24834\">Matt</a>. He blamed Betty and Hulk for his uncle's downfall and he wanted revenge against them. In order to draw out the Hulk he took Betty outside in front of the reporters and shot her in the leg, Hulk saw this and went ballistic. He jumped to his house and destroyed all of the Hulkbusters, then started heading towards Talbot. Talbot then shot her other leg to push Hulk over the edge so he would revert back to his Banner form.</p><h3>Banner No More</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932087\" data-ratio=\"0.77962962962963\" data-width=\"540\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 540px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5932087\"><img alt=\"War Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 540w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"War Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 540w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5932087-1274162139-war-h.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>War Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>Janis showed up with an alternate Hulk that came to <a href=\"/marvel-multiverse/4020-45892/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-45892\">Earth-616</a> when the Hulk was teleported away by Dr. Strange.

Godseye is programmed to adapt, and to match it's enemies strength. It and Hulk engaged in a prolonged battle in space, but as it tries to match the Hulk's strength, it exploded.</p><p>After finishing the mission, Hulk returned to the main shuttle, ready to return home. A broadcast from the Illuminati appears on the monitor, with the members of the Illuminati telling Hulk of their plans. They send Hulk farther into space in order to land on a lifeless planet in which Hulk could live quietly without harming any other beings. Enraged, Hulk begins to smash the ship, sending it off course. The ship goes through a wormhole, leading Hulk to the planet <a href=\"/sakaar/4020-41069/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41069\">Sakaar</a>, a harsh war-filled planet. Weakened, the Hulk was captured and enslaved.He was made to fight other slaves like him, in which only few survived, who later became the Warbound. He fought in the arena and bested his enemies with the help of his Warbound. Hulk and the other gladiators later escaped and went against the red king. He was named the Green Scar, Son Of Sakaar, the savior of their planet. Hulk defeated and made an alliance with Spikes, alien race that the red king used to kill his enemies with, along with much of nearby population. Hulk defeated the red king and became the new ruler of Sakaar. After defeating the red king, Hulk was viewed as a leader and a hero, so He and his queen <a href=\"/caiera/4005-42037/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42037\">Caiera</a> (the oldstrong) ruled Sakaar and everything in Hulks life was finally Good. However, Hulk happiness came to an end when the ship that brought the Hulk on this planet was emitting warnings that's it's power systems were failing. the Ship exploded before the Hulk could get rid of it and so it destroyed all life on Sakaar. Enraged, Hulk blamed the Illuminati for this and set out on a quest for revenge with his Warbound.</p><p>(To see more about this story arc check out the <a href=\"/planet-hulk/4045-41213/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41213\">Planet Hulk</a> page.)</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022236\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5078407720145\" data-width=\"829\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 829px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022236\"><img alt=\"World War Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 829w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 636w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"World War Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 829w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 636w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2022236-hulk_world_war4.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>World War Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>The ship that brought Hulk to Sakaar soon explodes killing many of the planet's inhabitants, including his wife and unborn child.

Hulk leads a raid against the heroes of earth, and has even attacked Professor X's institute, though Charles had not voted for Hulks exile, he was meant to be one of the people who had given the chance to play God, But hulk lets him off the hook since he sees that Charles has already been through enough. Despite the heroes best efforts, Hulk still manages to get justice for his suffering, he tells the heroes to remember that his war didn't kill anyone, and now they will forever know that they are killers and monsters. As Hulk finely finishes his War, Sentry appears and He and Hulk start to fight relentlessly. In the end however, Hulk emerges victorious , and as Banner and Rick are glad that everything is over, Miek savagely stabs Jones so that Banner would Hulk out and resume his raid. Hulk brutally pummels Miek with the warbound try to stop him, and it was at this time when Miek reveals that he knew that the space ship was going to blow up, he just didn't say anything so that the Hulk would do what a monster would always do which was destroy.

Ross, Iron Man, and Maria Hill. Accusations of the Hulk being the murderer quickly fade as facts start piling up suggesting it was someone else when it is revealed that real cause of death actually came from a gun. Gen. Ross remarks \"since when does the Hulk use a gun\". Doc Samson also finds that whoever killed Abomination was giving off so much radiation they turned dirt into glass underfoot. No sooner had these facts came to light The Winter Guard interfered and insisted the team leave Russia and allow them to resolve Abominations murder since it happened on Russian soil. Talking quickly breaks out into fighting until Gen. Ross stops the fighting announcing that he has found a survivor. The little girl can only say one word over an over....Red. Samson and Ross return to Gamma base with Ross grimacing at the fact that he needs help from Bruce Banner to which Banner replies \"I was wondering when you were going to ask for my help\". No sooner have they found that the murder weapon came from the shield helicarrier the Red Hulk attacks She-Hulk and renders her unconscious. Iron Man takes the fight to the mysterious new Hulk but is quickly defeated as well. As Red Hulk engages A Bomb Red Hulks identity is recognized by a robotic shield guard but is destroyed before the identity is announced. The resulting battle is of such magnitude it causes 10.0 tremors and breaks Banners holding cell causing him to Hulk out. Hulk quickly engages Rulk who is pummeling Uatu the Watcher. Hulk and Rulk exchange blows with Rulk showing he clearly has more combat experience than tactical skills than Hulk as Rulk put Hulk in a chokehold and slaps him repeatedly and breaking his arm to keep him from passing out. As Rulk stands over Hulk he pulls out a gun just as he proclaimed \"nobody would care if he blew Hulks brains out\" the Hulk came around and literally ate the gun. A short battle ensues and just as Rulk knocks Hulk of the top of a bridge Thor shows up swearing that Rulk <strong>WILL</strong> fall before Mjolnir. After a fierce battle the two end up in space where Rulk uses the zero gravity to his advantage and swings Mjolnir ravaging Thor. Rulk descends back to earth leaving Thor alive and swearing vengeance. A Bomb finds Hulk coming too under water and declares himself a friend to Hulk and Hulk battles Rulk once again with Rulk gaining the upper hand until Thor shows up for revenge. As Thor ravages Rulk to the point where Rulk admitted Thor would have killed him if the Hulk did not interrupt the battle declaring \"<strong>NOW RED HULK IS MINE TO HURT\" </strong>with A Bomb assuring Thor that hulk needed to win this battle against Rulk himself Thor agrees but assures A Bomb if Hulk should fall than the Red Hulks blood will run by his hands. Hulk absorbed Rulks blows in an effort to get angrier and eventually realized Rulks weakness which was the madder Rulk got the hotter he got which weakened him to the point where he almost passed out. With one swift and powerful punch Hulk knocks Rulk out cold. With Thor and Hulk declaring each other friends with Thor departing afterwards, Hulk battle weary and tired wanders off into the desert calling A Bomb \"Rick\" to A Bombs surprise. Shortly after A Bomb reverts back to Rick and Rick and tries to tell Hulk he knows who the Red Hulk is but is struck down by Samson before he can do so.</p><h3>Red &amp; Green</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3227649\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.0288065843621\" data-width=\"486\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 486px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3227649\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png 486w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111127061/3227649-joe%20fixit.png 486w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Bruce Banner has been captured again and in custody at Gamma Base. Bruce is examining an incident where Rulk (in Russia again) attracted a group of wendigos after killing a deer. This is when Bruce first realizes that \"the madder Rulk gets the <em>hotter</em> he gets\". Bruce concludes his findings to Gen. Ross adding that this hulk has no friends and \"<strong>SOON</strong> his enemies will want <strong>REVENGE</strong>\". Sometime later Bruce is free from custody and travels to Vegas where he runs into a group of wendigos attacking a casino. Despite his best efforts to stay calm he couldn't keep the Hulk bottled up, but due to his fear of letting the green Hulk out in such a populated area he unwittingly lets out the long suppressed grey Hulk (Joe Fixit). Fixit announcing his return to Vegas and engages the wendigos until he is attacked by Moon Knight who tells Fixit to leave. Fixit who is enraged by all this attacks Moon Knight and easily over powers him. Sentry and Ms. Marvel show up and tell Fixit to stop his attack resulting in Fixit hurling Moon Knight at them. Ms. Marvel overpowers Fixit while stating \"he may be smarter than the green Hulk but hes not nearly as strong\". She knocks him into a building which results in a massive power outage and also unleashes the green Hulk, being off the chart strong again this causes Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, and Sentry to attack the Hulk. Hulk gets tackled by Sentry with Hulk stating he remembers \"S man\" from when he declared war on the Illuminati, Marvel tells Sentry not to engage Hulk as he is only making Hulk stronger and the streets are still filled with people who could get hurt. As the wendigos start attacking again Hulk starts attacking them, but he is swarmed and bitten repeatedly turning him into \"Wendihulk\". Sentry attempts to take Wendihulk down but is easily overpowered with one arm as Wendihulk attempts to eat him. Ms. Marvel quickly gets ahold of Brother Voodoo who reverts Wendihulk back to the Hulk. Almost instantly Hulk turns back to Banner who flees the scene.</p><h3>Hulk No More</h3><p>Some time later, it was revealed that Banner had once again been captured.

Even though banner was no longer the Hulk, he still though the Jade Giant might come back, so he stared training Skaar so he would be able to do what needed to be done. Banner destroyed Juggernauts house so he could lure him towards him. Skaar and Cain engage in battle, however Skaar had no idea how to fight someone who could not be physically stopped, so he turn back in to his child form to hinder Cain for a moment. As soon as juggernaut was distracted Skaar punched him and they continued to fight in the air. They came crashing down and cracked the ground, and because of this they ended up in lava. Skaar tricked Cain into thinking that they were on the same side since they both hated banner. Because used this stratagem, he was able to punch Cain into orbit. Later Skaar would confront Daken, and he was nearly killed because of Daken's <a href=\"/muramasa-blades/4055-54935/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-54935\">Muramasa blade</a>, which disables the healing factor.</p><p>(For more info on this story view the <a href=\"/hulk-no-more/4045-56487/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56487\">Hulk No More</a> page.)</p><h3>Fall of the Hulks</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3217051\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3217051\"><img alt=\"The Hulks come down\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Hulks come down\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217051-9347525545-250px.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Hulks come down</figcaption></figure><p>The Red Hulk had \"killed\" Gen.

The Cathexis machine is basically the same machine that gave Leonard Samson and the Red Hulk their powers. The Leader reveals that all the Hulked-out-Heroes would soon die, because of the overload of radiation in their bodies. Bruce Banner and the other ‘smartest’ reconfigure the Cathexis machine to drain the radiation from the Hulked-out-Heroes, and so that the machine that's draining the radiation doesn't malfunction or explode, Banner willingly absorbs the excess gamma radiation into his body. The machine starts absorbing energy very quickly and Banner’s body could keep up with the absorption, so Samson (attempting to show that he was always a hero), walks to the machine and begins to help Banner absorb the energy as well. After absorbing Absorbed the energy, he turned into the Hulk once more. Hulk and Skaar then engage in a massive battle.

Bruce approaches Betty, trying to rekindle their estranged relationship, but only succeeds in angering her - causing her to transform into the Red She-Hulk. Immediately, she jumps several miles away, causing a good deal of destruction and alerting the authorities as to their whereabouts. After a short scuffle, Banner transformed into the Hulk and chased off after Betty. The two fought for a brief time, leaving Skaar in the care of Korg and A-Bomb. Skaar began to sense something amiss (at the exact same time as Amadeus Cho, Reed Richards, Tony Stark and Beast), and informed Korg and A-Bomb that he must find his father. They tell him to leave 'mommy and daddy' alone while they fought, but Skaar was insistent, and quite upset. Red She-Hulk and The Hulk were fighting but they eventually calmed down, and at that time Steve Rogers appeared and Amadeus Cho.</p><p>He informed Hulk that an alien planet (K'ai) had appered in the solar system and they didn't know why. Rogers needed Hulk's help, but Hulk declined. Skaar needed a word with the Hulk and told him that Hulk second son was on that planet heading this way. Steve started to launch an attack on the planet but was stopped by the Hulk, who smashed everything, Steve Rogers and some other heroes knocked out hulk, however it was revealed that Hulk was not fighting back and was just leading them in to a trap. Hulks family burst out of the ground and distracted the Secret avengers so that Skaar could reach the repair bay. Steve threatens to transport hulks family to the negative zone unless they could negotiate. Hulk De-powers and tells Rogers that he just saved everyone form his son by smashing the ship. The Hulks went to Planet K'ia to stop the force that was moving the planet. Banner transported his family in different parts of the planet, while he went directly to Hiro-Kala. Banner was ambushed mindless residents of the planet, who were defeated, but banner was also attacked by controlled children, so banner fled. Hiro-Kala appeared out of nowhere and and slaughters these children. Banner Hulk-out and called his son a \"Little monster\" .</p><p>Hiro-kala explained that he was trying to kill the old power so that trillions would be saved. This enraged hulk and he beat Hiro-Kala, but couldn't finish the job, so banner zapped him with an Old- power taser. Later Skaar appeared alive and well and defeated Hiro-kala, but he still tried to reason with him. Because of this, Hiro-Kala wanted to show skaar and banner why he had to destroy the Old power, But he could not manifest the memory because it was not real, this made Hiro-Kala bust in rage and Skaar stopped him by sealing him in stone. Banner told skaar to release his brother, but couldn't because the Worldmind allow it, they instead used this stone to heal the planet.</p><p>(For more information visit the <a href=\"/dark-son/4045-56241/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56241\">Dark Son</a> story arc page.)</p><h3>Chaos War</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079218\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5433333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079218\"><img alt=\"Hulk Faces Abomination\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk Faces Abomination\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg 600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2079218-hulk_chaos_war.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk Faces Abomination</figcaption></figure><p>As the Hulks return to Earth after battling Hiro-Kala, the astral projection of Doctor Strange appears, warning them of the danger posed by the <a href=\"/mikaboshi/4005-44368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44368\">Chaos King</a>, whom was consuming all of reality. Immediately upon arriving on the burning world, the Hulks went in search of Lyra. She is found beneath some burning rubble, still alive, but dreaming, like most of the beings on the planet. As the Hulks reconvene, demons begin to spew from the cracking streets, and from the center of the mass, the Abomination appears to attack the Hulks.</p><p>After temporarily Hulk out of the battle, Abomination, who has been greatly amped by the Chaos King, quickly turns his attention to Rick Jones/A-Bomb. In an act of brutality, Abomination tears A-Bomb's impervious armor from his very form. Despite the pain, A-Bomb manages to remain conscious as Abomination demands to know the location of A-Bomb's wife, Marlo Jones.</p><p>The reason for this is because Marlo possessed a spark of the cosmic entity Death within her, something that Abomination could sense through those she had been in close contact with.</p><p>While the Hulks are trying to find Marlo, Zom appears and attacks Hulk, but he and Abomination stop fighting and leave to find Marlo on flying monsters.

Herc informed him that Zeus has taken his throne again, and warned that if Banner so much as <i>irked</i> him, Zeus would kill him. Hercules knew that Banner would confront him regardless and upon his request, Herc punched Banner, changing him into his Hulk form. Hulk began to climb the mountain, fending off attacks from Poseidon, Artemis, Boreas, Apollo, and an army of Titans until he reached Olympus itself, only to be struck down swiftly by Zeus’s lightning.</p><p>The rest of the Hulk family had sailed out near the resurrected Mount Olympus and was quickly ensnared by the Kraken. As they fought below, Hephaestus checked on the green-skinned beast that Zeus had just struck down to find him still alive. Hulk rose to his feet and called Zeus a coward. Zeus unloaded another fury of lightning on the Hulk, but he simply shrugged it off. Hulk called out to Zeus that he <i>owed</i> his family, and though Zeus recognized that Hulk had aided him in the past, he recalled Hulk turning on him. To Hera’s surprise, Zeus removed his cloak and prepared to grant the Hulk’s request ‘to be beaten to death… by hand.’</p><p>Hulk landed the first mighty blow, sending Zeus smashing into some of Olympus’s giant columns. Zeus hurled another lightning bolt at Hulk but missed, and the Hulk didn’t even flinch. Angered, Zeus attacked Hulk, laying much of the surrounding area to rubble, and knocking Hulk and a large chunk of the mountain down toward the battered ship of the Hulks. As Hulk saw his family he yelled at them to leave before they ruined everything. Returning to the mountaintop, Hulk was battered by Zeus, even vomiting blood because of the beating.</p><p>As Hera taunted Hulk, telling him that this was the end, he told her that he didn’t care… just give his family what they owed them. Realizing that the hulk wasn't even trying to fight back, but only intended to sacrifice himself for the lives of his family, Zeus struck the Hulk one final time, giving Hephaestus time to chain him to the side of a cliff with ‘unbreakable’ chains. Much like Prometheus, who angered the gods by providing man with fire, vultures picked at Hulk for three days, as he lay chained to the mountain. His healing factor was just quick enough to keep him alive as the birds devoured his innards and eyes alike. On the third day, Hercules, Skaar, Red She-Hulk, She-Hulk and Korg arrived, freeing Hulk.</p><p>As Zeus and Hera watched from Olympus, a group of Sakaarian refugees, now living in the Savage Land were interrupted by Miek, claiming that he would soon kill the Hulk…</p><h3>Planet Savage</h3><p><b>King Miek</b></p><p>The group had taken the Hulk to Gammaworld in New Mexico, seeking the aid of Kate Waynesboro and the Warbound in healing the Hulk’s wounds at the hands of Zeus. The beating disrupted the Hulk’s healing ability, putting it at 7% of its normal efficiency, and as he lay on the table, Hulk began to go into ‘cardiogenic shock’. Waynesboro needed to use ventricular fibrillation to steady his heart and harnessed the energy of the Gamma Dome to deliver 2.53 gigajoules to his heart (the typical human gets 300 joules when being defibrillated).</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2969439\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1454261141517\" data-width=\"1279\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2969439\"><img alt=\"All Hail King Meik! \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" data-width=\"558\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 1279w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 838w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 558w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All Hail King Meik! \" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 1279w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 838w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2969439-02-10-11%2001%2024.jpg 558w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" data-width=\"558\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All Hail King Meik! </figcaption></figure><p>Hulk awoke in a blind rage, grabbing Waynesboro and crushing her arm. He could not be talked down and Red She-Hulk stepped in with a massive punch, putting him down. As Red She-Hulk looked to Kate’s injury, Kate explained that the Hulk only survived because of his family… that they give him the chance to let the hero come through. As the group slept that night, Hulk attempted to leave unnoticed, but Skaar, whom was holding one of Banner’s devices containing a message for him, followed him. Hulk, Korg, No-Name of Brood, Elloe, and Skaar boarded their transport and would now allow the rest of the Hulk family to come along. Before they departed, Hulk told Red She-Hulk that, “Hulk loves you too, Betty.”</p><p>As the group traveled to their destination, Hulk wanted to re-watch a message from Ka-Zar, beckoning him to the Savage Land to investigate the murders of 43 displaced Sakaarians living in the Savage Land. As they flew above the Savage Land, No-Name recognized a familiar scent, but was interrupted by a battle below between some Ka-Zar, several Sakaarians and some beasts of the Savage Land. Hulk jumped down quickly and knocked one of the large dinosaurs out, only to be bitten and impaled by another. Ka-Zar put the beast down with a spear to the eye and Skaar informed the group that the beasts were only trying to protect their young… and several speared youths are seen dead in the background.</p><p>The elder of the Sakaarians did not seem pleased by the Hulk’s presence and blamed his men’s killing of the beasts on their admiration of the Hulk. He chastised them for their celebration of the Green Scar’s return. As the group set up camp for the night and dined, Ka-Zar questioned Hulk’s decision to immediately proceed, due to his injuries, and insisted that tonight they rest. During the night, the village elder revealed that he had drugged the Hulk and his entire Warbound with nerve toxins developed by ‘the bugs’. Immediately, giant insects crawled in and began to haul away the unconscious body of the Hulk. The elder explained to one of the village members that they would simply tell the others that he had sacrificed himself to save them.</p><p>The Hulk was brought into a cave containing seemingly ‘impregnated’ bodies of dead Sakaarian villagers, and a now oversized Miek. Miek explained that his entire planet and race had been wiped out because of the Hulk’s revenge. He claimed that he did not do this out of anger, but because he had something to fight for once more.</p><p>As the group awoke the next day and the realization of the Hulk’s disappearance set in, Skaar became enraged, demanding the Sakaarian elder tell him the location of his father. No-Name began to ‘chem’ the perpetrator behind it all and as she discovered that Miek was the one to blame, he showed up with a horde of giant insects in tow. Miek instructed the Sakaarians to leave and told Ka-Zar to leave as well, but Ka-Zar refused, tussling with the Warbound against the insects.</p><p>Hulk ‘awoke’ in the cave Miek had imprisoned him in, stumbling out of a dream/hallucination that an insectoid female was attempting to seduce him. He actually woke up as he realized the woman’s face had changed to that of an insect. Hulk found himself strapped to an X-shaped apparatus with glowing blue vines holding him to it. As he gained consciousness he was able to watch as the trapped bodies of Sakaarians began to rip open, birthing insects. The insects being birthed began to crawl toward the Hulk and as he attempted to struggle against his bindings, they glowed brighter and held fast. Soon the insects were upon him, ripping into his flesh.</p><p>Hulk, still tired and unhealed from the fight against Zeus, relaxed against his constraints and gave control over to Banner. As Hulk changed into Banner, the size difference allowed Banner to slip out of the bindings. Banner, cussing at the Hulk for attempting to ‘smash his way out’ of things soon found himself smashing the insect that bit the Hulk with his own fists. As Banner escaped the cave, a large flightless bird attacked him, and as he ‘Hulked out’ again, his assailant threw him back. As Hulk rose to smash the bird, he found it covered by giant insects, whom quickly devoured the bird.</p><p>Skaar, Ka-Zar and the Warbound then showed up as Hulk realized that something was wrong in his own body. On his back he caught a glimpse of something crawling beneath the skin. Asking for Skaar’s help to remove the intruder, Hulk found himself in great pain as Skaar began to pull it out. No-Name warned Skaar to stop, as she could chem that the insects growing within him were attached to his heart… and to remove them would likely kill the Hulk. Hulk fell to the ground and demanded that Skaar remove the rest of the beasts within him, reminding the group that they were Hulks, after all. As Skaar readied to aid his father, several large insects swooped in and carried the Hulk back to Miek, whom was keeping Hulk sedated and hallucinating.</p><p>Miek explained to the drugged Hulk that Hulk had failed his other children, turning them ‘into monsters and misfits’. Hulk’s ribcage was exposed on his chest and the tentacles and bodies of foreign creatures could be seen beneath the bone. Miek covered the hole and Hulk’s chest with armor and handed him a sword, telling him that he would now protect the children and help him create a New Sakaar, with Miek as the king… and the strongest there is.</p><p>As Skaar, Ka-Zar and the members of the Warbound broke off from their pursuit of Hulk’s captors to rescue some Sakaarians under attack, Hulk reappeared. He was armored and being chemically controlled by Miek and began attacking the group, smashing Skaar first. The chemicals controlling Hulk took control of his desires to smash and reminded him of how good it felt to let go and stop caring. As Hulk approached Elloe and the Sakaarians under her protection, he hesitated, overcoming the chemicals forcing him to attack. Miek then appeared, once again tweaking the chemicals controlling Hulk.</p><p>Miek explained to the group that while in captivity by the humans, he had metamorphosed, changing gender. He then began to lay eggs, but the hatchlings would not survive, no matter how he tried to feed them. He found that the Hulk’s blood/body would provide the nourishment and strength that the hatchlings needed to grow and grow strong. He convinced the Warbound to help him convince the Hulk to allow his children to live, but at that moment, the chemicals burned off in Hulk’s bloodstream, and he attacked Miek. Hulk then tore the infants from his chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek.</p><p>Skaar then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a ‘stupid monster’. Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he’d care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of his arms chopped off by Hulk, before he punched Miek through a volcano and across the savage land, into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after, and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell, presumably to his death.</p><p>Upon Hulk’s return, Skaar told him to stand back, as he feared he’d returned to finish off Miek’s hivelings. As the Warbound protested, Hulk decided not to try to talk to Skaar, but instead to leave the Savage Land, as it is a place for savages… not monsters.</p><h3>Heart of The Monster</h3><p>As a Result of Current events, Red she Hulk had abandoned the hulk, which had left Bruce banner in a very bad state of mind. As Bruce and his family ( cho included) are simply talking how these events would and could have affected the jade jaws. As they are talking they feel a sudden earthquake, which is when they decided to rush to the training room. As they go there, they see hulk smashing ( shocker) , and they ask him “<i>are you okay?”</i> to which Bruce surprisingly replies that he is just fine. This is very odd considering the fact that banner of all people should have been raging since his true love just ditched him for his enemy. Bruce calmly explains that for a hulk, the stakes are too high, so he keeps his emotions in check.</p><p>Meanwhile, Betty and tyrannus are discussing matter in a chamber, but before conversation can go to something else Tyrannus draws a line and starts talking about his prized possession, <b><i>the fountain of youth!</i></b> Betty is about to taste the water from the fountain but Monica Pappaccini burst in with some Agents of AIM in order to gain the fountain of youth. Monica reveals the true potential of the wishing well, saying that it is really a fountain of youth, but Betty plunges her inot the water while saying “<i>you’re gonna wish you’ve never been born!”.</i> After that a bunch of Monsters Bursts out from a fountain in Las Vegas with Monica trying to fly away.</p><p>12 Hours later, Monica Comes to ask hulk for help, beaten half to death and barely standing. As Monica is in the infirmary, she explains what had happened, and they all leave for vegas. Along the way though, they talk about how specific one has to be in order for the wishing well not to ‘twist things up”. When they finely arrive at their destination, the start of course fighting the monsters which had threatened the civilians. But things go from bad to worse when Cho wishes for ‘help’, because the only help hulk received was his old enemies ( Bi-beast, Wendigo, Armaggedon, Umar, and Fing Fang Foom).</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2905522\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3377638780297\" data-width=\"1279\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2905522\"><img alt=\"HULK SMASH!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 1279w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 717w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 478w\"><noscript><img alt=\"HULK SMASH!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 1279w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 717w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905522-07_16_2011_20.jpg 478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\" data-width=\"478\"></noscript></a><figcaption>HULK SMASH!</figcaption></figure><p>While Hulk is preoccupied fighting a giant fish monster, Cho and Monica are attacked by the other villains, but when hulk intervenes he accidentally splashes the villains with the wishing water. Hulk and Cho teleport to vegas as a result of Bi-Beasts and Wendigos wish. Cho theorizes that since Betty made the first wish, everyone else’s desires revolve around hers, but their conversation is short lived since his enemies intervene. The city lifts up in the sky to replicate Bi-beasts long lost home, while in the mean time Hulk attacks and stops Wendigo from eating a fellow human, but he is disappointed that Wendigo is barely a threat due to hulk increasing in power over the years, so he accidentally wishes for a real fight, and as a result both Bi-Beast and Wendigo become much larger than the hulk himself. While Cho wishes everyone to safety, hulk unitizes his power and size to propel his enemies into out of the city. Cho and the President himself then appear with the help of a hologram in order to thank the hulk for saving the country 3 times in months, but then comes the worst part, Arm’chedon appears, and he seems to have betty and rick as a hostage. Arm’chedon states that hulk cousin and best friend are both injected with a Trojan Virus, which will take years to cure, and to add insult to injury he then throws jen and rick off his space ship, and they crumble down into the ground. Hulk gets seriously enraged and starts to go <b><i>world breaker,</i></b> but he manages to turn into banner before he causes serious damage.</p><p>Banner leaves it up to cho to find a cure for his friends with Monicas help, while he goes on to fight Arm’chedon and proceeds with utterly demolishing Arm’chedon. While Hulk is gloating with beatty, Arm’chedon blasts red she hulk with one of his very powerful canons, and hulk becomes even more enraged, and stomps Arm’chedon’s face into the ground. Hulk starts to lose control over himself, but luckily Umar steps in and calms him down. Monica and cho are working on saving Jen and Rick, while Betty trying to shake hulk out of Umars control, but in the end the events lead to hulk being transported into the dark dimension along with betty.</p><p>The others ask Dr Strange and Dr. Sofia for help to track down the hulk, but Dr strange seems reluctant, because the hulk presents a threat to the world, but in the end they convince him to fine play along. Meanwhile Hulk and Umar seem to be battling the mindless ones, hulk pushes them back, and umar makes a shield around here territory. After that they go to Umars castle to have sex, while Betty is with the goblins. When hulks Friends arrive, they find hulk fighting monsters, and they realize that hulk is in his paradise, but tyrannus emerges fighting fing fang foom, and says that this “heaven” belongs to him.</p><p>Hulk thunderclaps Fing Fang Foom into the Barrier made by umar, and so it shatters, and the mindless ones are set loose. Umar is very displeased that her castle had been destroyed, but hulk says the he will solve the problem. Since the planet has not innocent people around, he destroys the whole as a result of a shockwave caused by clashing with Red She hulk.</p><p>Hulk wasn't the only one who survived the explosion, as Umar was shown to have blocked the blast via an energy barrier, and afterwards, Hulk used the wish to review everyone else, and resumes his fight with Betty, while Tyrannys sends Fing Fang Foom to dispatch some gamma bombs so he could seize all the thrones of men (America)!</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2905524\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2905524\"><img alt=\"Here Comes The WORLD BREAKER!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 619w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 412w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Here Comes The WORLD BREAKER!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 619w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2905524-08_10_2011_14.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here Comes The WORLD BREAKER!</figcaption></figure><p>Monica refuses currently to help save Sofia and Cho, and while they are trying intimidate her, cho and Sofia seemed to have already transported back , and they are watching fing fang foom consuming dozens of gamma bombs, even they were supposed to be any left.

Betty tried to pick it up but she was unable to make it budge. When the Hulk touched the hammer, he was transformed into Nul, Breaker of Worlds. He became one of the <a href=\"/the-serpent/4005-77306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77306\">Serpent</a>'s <a href=\"/the-worthy/4060-58278/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58278\">Worthy</a> and went on a rampage in order to spread fear. As Nul, he battled Thor with the help of <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Angrir</a> (Thing). Thor was able to defeat the thing but he was no condition to fight Nul, so he knocked Nul into orbit to avoid further rampage. Nul ends up in the middle of Europe at the castle of <a href=\"/dracula/4005-7206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7206\">Dracula</a> and the vampire nation. Nul quickly breaks through the various armies of Dracula leaving the count no other choice but to use <a href=\"/the-forgiven/4060-58608/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58608\">The Forgiven</a>, a group of vampires that have left the vampire nation to try and stop the rampaging Worthy. Their efforts prove futile and when Nul finally reaches Dracula, Betty Banner is able to convince the Hulk to fight the Serpent's influence and he breaks his hammer in half, destroying the magic inside and returning to Bruce Banner. Banner soon returns to Hulk form and tells Dracula he is letting him live since he helped to reach him in breaking the Serpent's control over him and then leaves the <a href=\"/vampire-nation/4060-58455/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58455\">vampire nation</a> in ruin.

While talking to <a href=\"/agent-coulson/4005-70860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70860\">Coulson</a>, they review the last few disasters/disturbances that have occurred in hopes that they might have found the Hulk. However, none of them had been caused by Banner/Hulk. Ever since the war involving the Avengers, the X-Men and the Phoenix Force, the whole world has been on edge. And with the Banner/Hulk on the loose, it would appear that the world is even more on edge.</p><p>Suddenly, Maria is visited by someone she never expected to encounter... Dr. Bruce Banner. Maria is both stunned and intimidated by Banner's sudden appearance, comparing him to a nuclear bomb as he takes a seat at the table directly in front of her. Banner's sudden appearance, at least in this case, is no mere coincidence.</p><p>He then explains to Maria Hill that he is no longer wishes to act like some mopey, sullen teenager. He's one of the smartest beings on the planet. When he thinks, big things happen. Banner has spent his life trying to rid himself of the Hulk through any means necessary, and just about a month prior to meeting with Maria, after he gave it his best effort and failed. He accepted his fate and the fact that, at least in terms of modern science, there is no way for him to rid himself of the Hulk.</p><p>Banner then turns the conversation with a different direction, a beginning to discuss the recent events of the war involving the Avengers, the X-Men and the Phoenix Force. The Hulk played a vital role in fighting Emma Frost and Cyclops (each possessing 50% of the phoenix force) and then battling against the Dark Phoenix-possessed Cyclops.</p><p>Then he mentions who was responsible for dealing with the Phoenix, and some who think the real hero is Tony Stark (despite the fact that it was actually Hope Summers and Scarlet Witch who defeated the Phoenix Force) . Upset by this fact, Banner briefly causes a scene in the diner before calming himself down and apologizing to Maria Hill for frightening her before continuing their discussion.</p><p>Banner continues by explaining that Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Hank Pym and the other brilliant men will be remembered for the gifts of science they've bestowed to humanity. They are a small group of the smartest men to ever grace the planet. They would leave their mark on the world through their knowledge. On the other hand, Banner concludes that if he continues with what he's been doing for years, he would only be remembered as the man who transforms into a raging monster that destroys everything within his path. He doesn't want his tombstone to read <i>\"Hulk Smash\"</i>.</p><p>Banner then reveals to Maria Hill a device that he created, a Purification Unit, that can eliminate all waterborne diseases within the next five years. Astonished, Maria further questions Banner, who in turn informs her that he could create more devices that could benefit humankind if he were to recieve the proper resources from SHIELD. He then goes on to warn Maria Hill that if her or SHIELD try anything that could harm him, he'd expose them of their secrets in the form of a mysterious individual who is Banner's insurance against the agency.</p><p>After clearing the air, Banner and Hill begin to discuss his alter-ego: The Hulk. Even when managed, it is quite certain that sooner or later... Banner will transform into the Hulk. He can't stop it. But instead of Hulk being viewed as a nuclear gamma arsenal about to explode, Banner suggests that SHIELD could use Hulk like a cannon to be aimed at whatever threat needed to be dealt with. In other words, Hulk Smash!</p><p>Banner then informs Maria Hill that he knows that she and some SHIELD agents plan to go after the Mad Thinker, noticing how she would constantly look at the clock every few moments. Bruce warns her that going after Mad Thinker would be suicidal at best... unless they'd have some back-up in the form of a certain green monster. He offers Maria and SHIELD his and Hulk's service if they're willing to give him the resources that he needs, telling her that his offer will expire in ten minutes.</p><p>Accepting Banner's proposal, Maria and SHIELD are joined by the Hulk as they go to confront the Mad Thinker. Despite Mad Thinker's best defenses, using a giant robot that wields Quantom Molder blasts which can melt, reshape and liquify Ultron's Adamantium armor, Hulk withstands the brutal barrage effortlessly. In the final moment of the battle, Mad Thinker is horrified to discover that Hulk's strength/power is indeed 'incalculable' as the Green Goliath rips the robot in half, thus defeating him. Passing the 'test', Maria officially makes Bruce Banner an Agent of SHIELD.</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2762183\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5369791666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2762183\"><img alt=\"Damn, Tony... you're dead!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Damn, Tony... you're dead!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2762183-ih_02_012.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Damn, Tony... you're dead!</figcaption></figure><p>Nine Days since banner got recruited into shield, and there was a strict rule of no visitors made by Maria hill and Banner, but Tony stark aka iron man did not take no for an answer. Stark arrives and tells maria that whoever is controlling banner to work for shield should cut it out, But Maria herself explains that even she was surprised at banners change of heart. Before Tony confronts banner he looks around and checks out banners invention, and to Stark's surprise banners creations include a device that could prevent a lot of cancers. As Tony enters to see banner, he is baffled by the fact that Bruce is laughing hysterically, but they both start laughing as tony himself checks out the formula which can only be funny if you’re smart, something maria hill isn't. Banner and tony go to test Banner's newest invention, they got to the Himalayan Mountains and Banner explains the first step of his plan. Banner (while he had put on his new suit of armor) had built a gamma fracker in order to extract natural gas without causing harm, but when the process of fracking doesn't actually occur, tony tries to modify banner machine, which frustrates Bruce and forces him to reveal that the second reason he bought tony here was because He never treated Bruce as an equal, and this was a chance to blow off some steam. Banner transforms into the hulk and starts to attack tony, but since tony never managed to finish the modifications, the device was set to explode, but in the last second hulk jumps in and saves iron man form the explosion. Tony and banner are soon to be siting and talking while afterwards, and during this time banner remarks “you’re <i>a <b>Brilliant Engineer,</b> Tony -- but all <b>you</b> ever do is build <b>forward</b> from what you already <b>know</b>. A <b>true</b> visionary studies the <b>unknown</b> and builds <b>backward.</b> It’s a <b>new field</b> -- and a <b>legitimate</b> one.

Four Volunteers are interviewed, and four of them seem to be ok with the fact that Dr. Banner could transform into a giant Green man-Monster, hinting that each and every one of them has a secret of their own. The assistance are Chosen in different particular fields: Daman Veteri ,Ed.D. is a Molecular engineer, Randall Jessup. M.SC. a Renewable Energies expert,Melinda Lecusenstern, PSY.D., M.S Climatologist/Astrophysicist, And Patricia Wolman, D.I.T is a Micro neural Biology expert. Meanwhile banner is on his fits mission, which is Providing a distraction for The shield agents to do their work. A.I.M sends in agents to capture The last member of The Quintronic crew, but Shield pulls a switch in the last moment. While the agents were distracted by shield, Banner switched his place with the last crew member, and Since they had put and mask that covered the face completely, no none noticed the trick. When the Shield agents were killed, it was banner who had been taken in instead of of the target. Banner meets Colin Thirty-Three, But as The mask is taken off, Banner can already smells the urine form the Guards, because he went green and mean. Hulk had been the perfect distraction, but as the shield agents were fighting A.I.M , Colin activates The Quintronic man , but this seemed impossible since it takes five men to operate the robot, and the crew members had been dead, However, it was revealed that Thanks to Electrochemichal Technology, The machine had adapted the Full psionic access to the dead crew members abilities, so Colin was still able to operate the Device. The Quintronic man plunges hulk into molten lava, claiming that this machine had been made for space exploration, therefore it could withstand any temperature. As hulk seem so have been burnt in lava, he then emerges damage free, and breaks the glass in which Colin had been seated, meaning that he had been scrambled alive, while hulk growled in rage. As hulk was coming out of the molten lava, he reverts to banner, and he had been blistered a bit. As Banner is resting in the hospital, Maria comes in and they discuss Banner's new teammates. Banner says that he is positive that the members are hiding something, considering that they had singed up for to work with the hulk, but it will not be a problem. Also Maria forgets to mention hulks new <i>\"best friend\"</i> R.O.B, so maria can monitor hulks actions. Banner expresses his distaste by breaking the robot.</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2885450\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5369791666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2885450\"><img alt=\"Hulk smash water?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk smash water?\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2885450-indestructible_hulk_004_019.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk smash water?</figcaption></figure><p>Banner wakes up, and exclaims how he hasn't got a decent sleep in a long time. While he is getting dressed he finds green paint on him, but he ignores it. As he walks out, it is seen that Banner is living in a nuclear testing town, which has been renamed as \"Bannerville\". As he is on his way to work, he is talking to some unknown person, and it seems that he and Banner have a pretty good friendship. As Banner reaches his destination, he introduces himself to his new co-workers. As Banner finishes up with his short introduction, the assistants pile up with a lot of questions. Banner says that he will explain the obvious, but he then suddenly explodes with anger over the fact that there is no internet connection. While the assistants are paralyzed, Banner says that because their pants are still clean, they passed the final exam. He then proceeds that they must stay true to his new motto, \"Hulk breaks, Banner builds\"! Banner then presents his helpers with Uru metal, saying that Thor provided it years ago, while saying that it was enchanted, which is something Banner defines as \"<i>containing unfamiliar subatomic properties\".</i> Banner leaves the Uru metal in the hands of his assistants, while he himself is summoned by Maria Hill. Maria informs Banner that the legendary city of Lemuria he was looking for ....had been found, along with some giant monsters, which were controlled by Attuma, and had killed many people. Maria tells Banner that the underwater warlord is planning to regain sovereign reign over the entire Pacific Ocean. This is where the Hulk comes in, he has to travel under water and fight and stop Attuma, with the help of the underwater version of the Helicarrier built by the Chinese called Dreadnought. In the submarine itself, Banner can't understand anyone, but he hears a familiar voice, speaking american, and he sees R.O.B. Banner is very angry about this, but before he can do anything, they are all attacked by Attuma. Banner is ambushed by his own men and dragged into some device which instantly turns him to the Hulk. Hulk bursts out of the ship and starts to fight his enemies, but is blasted off. He isn't done yet, he is barely even hurt, but before he can proceed with smashing, Attuma confronts him, and explains that he has yet to learn the dangers that lie in the depths of the ocean, so he is dragged into darkness by some monster. The pressure is rising above 8 tons, and it was still increasing, thus the Hulk was absorbed in the depth of the ocean, but he was saved by the very people/atlantians who stand against attuma.</p><p>In the mean time Attuma explains in fury to his subjects, that Limura is just a means to an end, he only uses the magical monsters of the city that there will be no protest from his fellow Atlantians when he tries to force his rule on the them, and despite the fact that Limuarian fleet is still loyal to Attuma, the only thing he requires from them is the weapon the chief wizard has built him.</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942217\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.68895348837209\" data-width=\"688\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 688px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2942217\"><img alt=\"HULK SPLASH!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 688w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"HULK SPLASH!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 688w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2942217-prv15399_pg4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>HULK SPLASH!</figcaption></figure><p>Banner on the other hand is still coming to his senses, and as he wakes up, he sees a beautiful Atlantian, who seems far more interested in Banner's alter ego, so she asks him to change back. Banner explains that the change is bit more complicated that one would like to believe, but before she could respond, her love, Canor, warns banner not to do anything with his betrothed, to which Mara replies that she is not interested in this scrawny human and she is most definitely not HIS property. Canor later takes banner in to a fortress which had been the city itself before Attuma attacked, and the reason for them saving hulk was because they saw him as a powerful ally, which would be useful because Attuma has acquired a very powerful weapon. When Banner sees the plans for this weapon, he says simply <i>\" We're screwed\",</i> and Attuma's potential danger is seen when he launches the weapon on the Chinese men that came with Banner in the first place, which causes them to burn to the bone. After more research, Banner deduces that Attuma is using a very powerful solvent, acid, that can eat through anything, even it;s own container, but that's not all, Attuma plans to transform the world’s oceans to a floating foam of acid, which would mean the end of all air-breathers.</p><p>The rebels start to initiate the attack; and Bruce figures that the fastest way to Hulk out is to kiss Mara, which unsurprisingly works. They ambush Attuma and his minions, and while the other are occupied, the big guns take it out on each other. In the end, the fight leads to Hulk being consumed by a giant magical monster whose skin cannot be penetrated, but even that is not enough to stop the hulk, and Attuma's terror is defeated. Mara is ecstatic at the Hulk's power, so she kisses him, but she isn't too happy when Banner returns. The attack was successful, and in the end, Banner is not left empty handed, he managed to smuggle the secret formula to the ancient solvent.</p><h3>Gods And Monster</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2961474\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5369791666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2961474\"><img alt=\"Smash at Thee!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 1249w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Smash at Thee!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 1920w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 1249w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2961474-indestructible%20hulk%20006-021.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Smash at Thee!</figcaption></figure><p>Banner and his assistants are working on creating a portal to<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/jotunheim/4020-57502/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57502\"> Jotunheim</a>, and while the others are busy with work, banner contemplates about his coworkers. There is a reason Banner had selected these helpers, each of them is hiding a very important secret , but Banner was least suspicious of Patty, but even with her there are signs, suggesting that she is concealing something, considering the fact that Patty was trying to make Banner Hulk out. Banner himself and three of his assistants enter the portal which they open, all with high tech armor , and one of them his left to operate the portal itself Banner's mission is to locate <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eiderdurm/4055-57351/\">Eiderdurm</a>, a source of liquid that can only exist at sub zero temperature. The opening of the portal forces Thor to see what had happened, since Mjolnir had picked up some strange energy signature. Thor warns the mortals about the dangers of Frost giants, and Banner is surprised that he is not able to recognize him.</p><p>As they are exchanging words, frost giants storm in and attack them, and while Thor fights them, Banner is frozen before he could assist his ally. Thor advises Banner's team to take cover and run as he is attacked from the back, which forces him to drop his hammer. Hulk then comes out, angrier than ever. He tears through the frost giants and sees Mjolnir laying around, he tries to pick it up, and though it was difficult at first, he raises the hammer and yells <strong>\" HULK.... WORTHY!\"</strong></p><p>However, it turns out that the reason Hulk was able to lift Mjolnir was because of the fact that Thor had summoned it from far beyond. Hulk and Thor quickly settle things and decide to fight off the frost giants. Before they get there Banner's assistants are trying to survive the assault from the giants. As the Helpers are captured, Thor and Hulk charge in to fight theses monsters off, but one of them discovers the portal from which the humans came from. Because of this, while Hulk and Thor are fighting, Shield is forced to shut the portal down, and when they activate it again, there are multiple places where the portal could lead, so bringing the team back was completely impossible unless they could locate the specific area in which they had been residing. During the battle two major things happen, Patty tries to commit suicide by jumping off one of the frost giants arm, but luckily Hulk saves her. Also, one of the frost giants use their powers to trick Banner's team into believing that one of the frost giants is one of the assistants, meaning that they could learn more about the portal. As the others are camping in the lands of Jotunheim, Banner first explains to Dr. Veteri that he unknowingly created a time machine, which would explain why Thor cannot recognize the hulk . The team manages to set up camp fire and find something to eat, at this time Banner and Patricia Discuss the event that had happened to her a few hours ago, to which Patty confesses that she is committed to S.B.H- Suicide By Hulk.</p><p>This matter is discussed further, and Patty tells Banner her story, about how she is her fathers only benefactor, and since she has been diagnosed with a fatal disease , no one could provide for him. Suicide wasn't an option either , because Patty's father wouldn't get anything from it, while working in close proximity with Hulk would definitely pay for itself. Banner suggest that maybe there still is hope for a cure, but Patty has lost faith in that. The conversation then re-directs itself about a new topic, which was about Hulk's hammer stunt a few hours back. Patty asks why Hulk could not have lifted Thor's hammer, since Hulk was stronger. To which Banner replies \"That's an eternal debate.\" then further explains that lifting Mjolnir was not about strength, but about who is worthy. Bruce further explains on how the whole concept of being \"Worthy\" worked by providing a scientific theory<i>: The hammer can emit gravitation particles through nanotechnology, when someone is deemed unworthy the hammer increases it's gravitational pull, making it impossible for someone to lift Mjolnir\".</i> The other theory was that Mjolnir was just pure magic, but patty gets mad since none of this has to do anything with a cure for her disease.</p><p>At this time Randal, or more specifically the spy was communication with his king distantly, while Thor and Veteri were thinking up a way to get the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eiderdurm/4055-57351/\">Eiderdurm</a>. Veteri purposes that they use Thor's hammer to create an electromagnetic field to channel the fall of absolute zero. And amazingly the plan works, but as soon as the portal to home opens, the spy reveals himself , punches Thor into the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eiderdurm/4055-57351/\">Eiderdurm</a> fall and calls upon his fellow frost giants. The charge toward the portal, so Maria hill summons her agents to fend them off, but they are not alone, because the Hulk does some smashing too. At some point of the battle Hulk remembers that Thor has to be saved, he jumps in the magic fall, and through Banner's awesome tech and his great durability, Hulk saves Thor, and they Together, pound the ground and turn the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/eiderdurm/4055-57351/\">Eiderdurm</a> fall into a river by cracking the ground.

This man, is Matt Murdock, also known as Daredevil, who has been appointed as Hulk's lawyer. As Maria Hill sees Banner talking with someone about a classified shield operation, she starts no doubt yelling. Banner explains the situation and tells her to chill playfully, which angers Maria.</p><p>Before they deploy for combat, Maria gives Banner a parachute and tells him that he can just watch from a distance, simply to take a break, of course little did Banner realize that the parachute was fake and it was just Hills way of paying Bruce back because of his constant need to make her angry. Bruce Hulk's mid-air and starts raiding the Thor-Level ordinance transfer. At this time, with Banner's invitation, Daredevil appears to help out. He jumps in to fight along-side Hulk, but once one of the AIM agents activate a sonic weapon, which would specifically be very harmful for Daredevil due to his enhanced sense, Matt is quickly rendered into one place, which leaves Hulk to power on through, and that he does.</p><p>When the action is over, Bruce finds that one of the AIM minion is missing, along with a destructive weapon. So using DD enhances senses, he and Matt track down the agent by following the frequency given of the Kinetic Microgenerator. When they track him down, they enter the bar, with Daredevil leading. When the thugs see Matt they pull out their guns, ready to shoot him down, that's of course until they see Hulk come smashing through the door.</p><p>Daredevil pinpoints the guy they are looking for by listening to his heart beat. But when he does so, the AIM agent activates the weapon to a much stronger level, and Hulk gets really angry and powers on through again, only this time a massive explosion is cased, and the agent escapes. He goes to a specific address, where he finds Baron Zemo! Who of course isn't pleased that he didn't completely recessive his shipment, he simply got one gun. After asking the AIM henchmen whether he was followed or not, he executed him. The sound wave of the gun was cough by Daredevil, who had just been saved by Hulk from a charging train after ending up underground after the bar squabble.</p><p>After Tracking Zemo down, a battle breaks out, and the events lead to the point where Hulk has been blinded. While Zemo and some of the henchmen escape, Hulk becomes increasingly angry and starts smashing mindlessly, one of the henchmen charge in and due to their own stubbornness die. Daredevil calls Maria for help, which is why she links him with Banner's assistants, they advise him to use the gun which produces sound to stabilize Hulk's condition, unfortunately Daredevil couldn't make out the signs on the gun, meaning that he had to try everything out. The battle leads eventually outside, where they accidentally crack a building, with Daredevil standing under it. Hulk regains his vision in time to save him, and does so. after some time, Matt gets treated for his wounds, but Banner is nervous because he thinks Maria is at a breaking point with him and their deal.</p><h3><em><strong>AGENT OF TIME</strong></em></h3><p>For sometime now, the Heroes of the Marvel universe has been tampering with time, and as a result ,the Space-Time Continuum had been shattered, and despite <a href=\"/zarrko/4005-9479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9479\">Zarrkos</a> Help, No one is durable enough to survive the time-stream...except the Hulk.

Zarrko explains that the Hulk is the only one who can save everyone and survive the time-stream, and while Banner is reluctant at first, Zarrko corners Banner into agreeing when he makes him realize that due to the time being tampered with by villains known as <strong><em>T</em></strong><em><strong>he Chronarchists,</strong> </em>Bruce can't even remember Betty's name. Also, Hulk's personality fluctuates due to his past being changed multiple times, so unless Banner takes action soon, Hulk might become mindless again.</p><p>The situation is quite complex,Banner cannot complete his mission without the Hulk, and he has to stay as the Hulk at all times considering that he would most likely die if he appears due to the effects of the time-stream and his consciousness is carried over to R.O.B to guide the Hulk, therefore having two Banners would result in something seriously bad.</p><p>Their First traveled to A.D.(1873). The first thing that took place right as they came to this time period was them being ambushed by a dinosaur in the presence of<a href=\"/kid-colt/4005-7238/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7238\"> Kid Colt</a>, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/two-gun-kid/4005-7240/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7240\">Two-Gun Kid</a>, and <a href=\"/rawhide-kid/4005-4069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4069\">Rawhide Kid</a>. After Hulk deals with the dinosaur, Banner explains the situation to the gang and they all agree to do what is right. The Chronarchist in question was <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/tok-baltusar/4005-91787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91787\">Tok Baltusar</a>, a criminal scientist from the 23rd century. As Hulk engages Tok's dinosaurs, the cowboy gang is ambushed by a bunch of speed enhanced minions. As the gang is being overwhelmed Hulk dispatches the threat and comes to the rescue while Banner instructs the others on how to take Tok down. If they trike the glowing panel on his armor, it might destabilize him.</p><p>There are certain things that Banner found odd in Tok's actions. Why would he come to the 1873 with dinosaurs, clearly the people here weren't advanced enough for Tok to need the upper hand? But then It occurred to Banner that the dinosaurs were just a convenient plus to the situation. Due to the energy readings it was clear that Tok had went back to the prehistoric age to infect the silver vein so it could be over years transformed into alloy, which is used for time-travel.</p><p>As the team of cowboys dealt with Tok, Banner taunted Hulk into destroying the mines in which this alloy was picked up from. However due to the high radiation levels, Hulk's armor started to malfunction, therefore teleporting him to Camelot.</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3410340\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56267409470752\" data-width=\"1436\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1436px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3410340\"><img alt=\"Joe Fixit Goes up against sand man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 1436w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Joe Fixit Goes up against sand man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 1436w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3410340-indestructible%20hulk%20%2314%20005.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Joe Fixit Goes up against sand man</figcaption></figure><p>There Hulk yet again defeated another Chronarchist with the help of The<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-knight/4005-3172/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3172\"> Black Knight</a> and his allies. However it seems that because of his constant interference, one of the Chronarchists had gone back in time to alter the Hulk's origin. This causes a chain of events which forces Hulk to fight many of his previous foes such as Abomination and Sandman while constantly shifting through different incarnations. As Hulk is transported to the <em>Columbus expedition,</em> he becomes the G<em>reen Scar</em>. Banner, or Rob, tries to analyze the situation, however Fin Fang Foom appears out of nowhere and engages Hulk in combat. But he proves to be a unimpressive adversary to the powerful Green Scar who uses his size, power and speed to immobilize Fin Fang Foom.</p><p>Meanwhile, the final Chronarchist, Khotto, is altering the Gamma bomb( the Original One) with temporal components mined by Tok. This of course, is for the purpose of freeing Zarrko, who is in fact behind all of this. Hulk is then teleported way back to his birthplace, where he encounters Banner(himself) trying to save Rick Jones. Hulk pushes Banner into the pit and gets dosed with the same gamma radiation which had turned him into the Incredible Hulk. During this time Banner realized that The constant time acceleration had left his artificial body in a bad state, so he quickly transferred his intelligence to his younger self as a means to save the mission. Lucky Banner's plan worked, but a new problems arose. The radiation effects from the double gamma bomb dosage had altered the Hulk in many ways.</p><p>The result of the Gamma Radiation was the Hulk had become much more monstrous,mindless and strong. Banner bathes in his moment of freedom but upon coming to the realization that Betty has been erased from time, he understands that in his selfish moment he forgot that currently there are no properly groomed heroes to stop this new uber powerful Hulk. Banner searches for some residual gamma radiation to regain his power and stop the atrocity trashing the soldier when he comes across Khotto. It turns out that the Chronarchists had been working for Zarrko all this time, and they had purposefully created a new Hulk so he'd be strong enough to dig Zarrko out of a very specific and impenetrable prison. Banner looses his cool and charges towards Khotto and activates the time armor. They then travel back in time to the gamma bomb blast, however due to the time component added to the gamma bomb, time starts to move very slowly, therefore the transformation takes some time to kick in. Banner dukes it out with the final Chronarchist until he sees the new Hulk Squared come charging for him through the time-stream.</p><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3460242\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.18603439291298\" data-width=\"1919\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1919px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:18.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3460242\"><img alt=\"Run, now!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 1919w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Run, now!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 1919w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/3460242-17.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Run, now!</figcaption></figure><p>Banner manages to Hulk out and shatter the time barrier, which is how he manages to grab Zarrko and pull him into the time-stream.

Everything seems to work out for the best...except it didn't.

It was then that a new Hulk persona emerged in the form of Doc Green: The Smartest &amp; Strongest One There is. This particular incarnation of the Hulk neither recognizes himself as either Dr. Bruce Banner or any of the various Hulk personas/incarnations. He has thus made it his mission to eliminate all gamma-based weapons and threats from the planet.

Hulk/Banner's increase in gamma radiation in proportion to stress(caused by his own physical exertion/anger or outside forces), converting it to stronger cellular mass (stronger DNA which, in turn, produces stronger/denser organic tissues), negating what would be lethal force in order to survive. The growth of Hulk's gamma ray-fueled transmutation gives him potentially limitless strength extending to unparalleled abilities of regenerative healing, stamina, and durability.</p><h3>Vast Superhuman Strength</h3><p>Hulk is physically one of the strongest and most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. His limitless strength usually depends on his emotions, especially his rage. Possessed with infinite gamma rays/energies from every dimension/universe in existence, the Hulk is in the Class 100 ton strength range, meaning that he can easily lift over the 100 ton limit. Hulk has the potential to truly be \"The strongest one there is\".</p><p>However, this may vary depending on the incarnation/persona, and also how angry the Hulk is at a certain point. It is well known that the angrier Hulk gets, the more stronger and powerful he becomes. It is a well known fact that Bruce Banner has always suppressed the Hulk and his power, if only out of fear of harming others... especially those that both Banner and Hulk hold dear. But there has been a few times that neither Banner or Hulk could control their fury, thus the result have been quite devastating to say the least.</p><h3>The Hulk's feats:</h3><ul><li>Catching and supporting a collapsing 150 billion ton mountain range using barely any leverage.

He went up against <a href=\"/\">Graviton</a></p><p>who was making it literally impossible for anyone to move a muscle. While the Likes of Iron Man, Wasp and Thor lay pinned to the ground, Hulk was moving despite Graviton putting tons of extra weight on him on top of the containers he was throwing to stop Hulk from moving. This is the most likely reason why Hulk is incredibly fast. He can defy gravity.</p><h3>Vast Superhuman Durability</h3><p>Hulk's skin is extremely durable, his skin can easily resist a Ground Zero explosion, Human Torch's Nova Blast, planet-Shattering impacts, and a blast from <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>. Hulks durability also increases with his rage. Hulk has also been able to take a blast which Ultron used to soften and manipulate adamantium.</p><h3>Healing Factor</h3><p>In proportion to stress, Hulk can instantly renew and augment the atomic-molecular structure of the most basic biological component, the DNA/amino acids, from which all the various uniquely tasked proteins, categorized by cell type and multiplied into tissues and organs, are formed. Hulk's healing factor is superior to that of Wolverine's because it is not limited in the energy necessary to maintain this core foundation.</p><h3>Adaptation</h3><p>Hulk is capable of adapting to inhospitable environments when ever it becomes necessary. There were many occasions where Hulk not only survived in airless areas, but has also spoken in them. Same as his healing factor and strength, the angrier hulk gets, the faster he adapts. In the early comics, Hulk also had the ability of flight.</p><h4>Self Sustenance</h4><p>Hulk's physiology allows him to survive for a long period of time without food, water or air after he has adapted.</p><h3>Astral Form Perception</h3><p>The Hulk has the unique ability of being able to see \"astral forms\"--or ghosts. Hulk is able to see Dr strange astral form when no one can, which comes in handy when working with his fellow defender strange. The reason for hulk developing this ability could be because of the fact that banner feared his fathers ghost would come back and hunt him. however, hulks astral from perception has not shown it's limitations yet, seeing as how he once experienced a whole town in the middle of the desert until it faded away. while it is possible that this was merely a mirage, it is also credible that hulk witnessed a town that didn't exist in our reality . there was a case during world war hulk when hulk broke Dr strange's hands while he was in his astral form.</p><h3>Vast Superhuman Stamina</h3><p>Hulks stamina is also very high, in a normal calm state, he can go on for several days before he even begins to feel tired. Hulk's stamina increase with his anger.</p><h3>Energy Projection/Absorption</h3><p>When sufficiently enraged The Hulk emits omnidirectional bursts of Gamma rays, to hugely destructive effect. These Gamma shockwaves were capable of utterly annihilating Fin Fang Foom and Arm'Chedon.</p><p>The Hulk's body soaks in radiation like a sponge, using it to empower himself. Increasing not just his usual abilities but also on occasion his size.</p><p> </p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><h3>Hulks And Banners Relationship</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2720591\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5377446411929\" data-width=\"1073\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1073px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2720591\"><img alt=\"You let mommy die!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 1073w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"You let mommy die!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 1073w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 624w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2720591-hulk_season_one_076.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You let mommy die!</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact that there have been many incarnations of the hulk, the one thing that almost never changes is that hatred hulk and banner have for each other. The banner/Hulk relationship is a lot like the <a href=\"/dr-jekyllmr-hyde/4005-22215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22215\">Dr. Jekyll's/Mr. Hyde</a>'s. it revolves around The good vs bad, Order vs Chaos concept, however, banner and the hulk has a far more intriguing connection in comparison to Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. The main difference is that Hulk is not a bad guy, he is not the villain, he is misunderstood, and in fact, when given the chance, he has done the right thing many numerous occasions . Hulks hatred for banner was manifested when banners mother died at that hand of their father, Brain Banner. Hulk acknowledges the fact that he and Banner are one and the same, hence he blames banner for being weak and not being able to defend their dear \"mommy\", and as any kid would traditionally do, Hulk blames a part of the incident on himself, and so he takes his anger out on Bruce, same way his father did to him out of Fear. Their relationship can also be considered ironic, seeing as how a small frail intelligent man gets turned into a green behemoths who is potentially one of the strongest beings on earth. But there are more to banner that meats the eye, banner represents will, because he is charge of controlling a very powerful being. despite no being physically weak , banner the strongest when it comes to inner Strength of the mind, because even though banner had taken hell as a child and still managed to turn out relatively normal. Hulk on the other hand is not banners dark side (that would be devil hulk), he represents many aspects of Bruce, the traditional Savage hulk represents banners angry child self who was abused by his father, he is very strong due to the fact that most kids view themselves sometime as an unstoppable force , while the grey hulk represents the wild teenager banner never got to be. Banner and Hulk have cooperated before, but no matter how hard they try the still seem to hate each other. Over the years banner has learned to use hulk sometimes as a weapon, in fact most recently, banner has joined shield because he has some unknown plans of his own, so instead of a gamma bomb, Hulk will be more like a targeted UMD.</p><p>They seemed to learn to accept each other in a series that's not too old, after they had been separated completely. Banner turned insane without the Hulk, and they both later learned that they both need each other.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Banner himself, along with some Hulk incarnations, possesses a genius level scientific intellect. Banner is one of the 8 smartest people on Earth. No one knows gamma radiation better than he does. In his main form, hulk has the brain of a child, however, he is by no means stupid, he can learn new things and had used some bizarre tactics to best his enemies before.</p><h3>Psychic Link</h3><h4>Homing ability</h4><p>We can conclude that Hulk also has a very interesting homing ability, since he has been able to return to New Mexico where he fist became the Hulk on many occasions, However later Maestro's image explained that Bruce was only able to do this because of his spirit, who was calling for him. However this proved to be false since the hulk was still able locate his birth place and use this homing ability after Maestro was revived. This homing ability has also been used to find people on many occasions. For example , Hulk was able to locate Rick Jones, Betty and The Abomination without knowing anything about their prior whereabouts.</p><h4>Gamma energy manipulation</h4><p>The hulk is able to manipulate gamma energy, he has done it many times. by emitting gamma energy the hulk nearly demolished the eastern seaboard with a step, destroyed a planet in the dark dimension( with help of brute force), and afterwords absorbing gamma energy from gamma bombs and briefly becoming 80 feet tall. Armageddon once tried to use the hulks emitting gamma energy to bring his son back to life</p><h4>Other abilities</h4><p>The events of Planet Hulk, World War Hulk, and its aftermath shed greater light on the Hulk's abilities. On the Planet Sakaar, his blood has been shown to transmit its regenerative abilities to making the alien flora germinate and grow at a rapid pace. <a href=\"/amadeus-cho/4005-43587/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43587\">Amadeus Cho</a> also postulated that Banner's persona and intellect influence the Hulk to a greater degree than previously thought. He deduced that the Hulk is like him in many ways, able to calculate the effects of his actions to a degree so fine that he can use the maximum amount of force in any given time, and yet not kill anyone. Cho backed up his theory with the fact that despite the Hulk unleashing more power than he had ever shown before in the World War Hulk event, no one died at his hands, whether directly or indirectly.</p><h4>Combat and weapon training</h4><p>While spending time on Planet Sakaar, Hulk has learned how to fight better with many kind of warrior/gladiator type weapons. Furthermore, it was seen that during the time when Hiro-Kala was trying to destroy earth, Hulk and Banner were now working together strategically to subdue their enemy, which makes the hulk a much more formidable foe.</p><h3>Longevity</h3><p>Because of his healing factor that regenerates his cells, and the gamma energy he has absorbed that empowers him, the Hulk can live longer then is normal. A possible future persona, the Maestro, was in physical prime in spite of being more than one hundred years old. In another alternate future it is implied that the Hulk's body effectively lasts forever but there is much question if that is true.</p><h3>Weaknesses</h3><p>Hulk's skin can be harmed by materials such as <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">Adamantium</a> and <a href=\"/vibranium/4055-40919/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40919\">Vibranium</a>. The Hulk can also be knocked out with gas, and is susceptible to mental attacks, but when extremely angry Hulk usually overpowers them. Arguably, when Hulk sees that he is being manipulated, he can overpower them. Like when Amora was manipulating the Hulk. After being manipulated initially, the spell broke when he sqashed the wasp between his hands. Afterwards when Amora tried to manipulate him again, Hulk broke through.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>After Banner was deprived of the Hulk, at the hand of Red Hulk, he showed just how smart he is. His inventions include:</p><ul><li>Banner has a mobile operating system that he can hack sophisticated systems with in moments and seems to be controlled mentally for the most part. Banner has a specific mobile system with which he can hack many systems, and is controlled mentally</li><li>Banner has a host of scanners with which he can scan everyone on a 50 radius. He can also send in a bot to preform advanced bio scans</li><li>Banner has a pocket dimension teleporter in his bag, which he uses to grab things from the lab.</li><li>Banner has managed to create a gamma old power fluid shield that can protect him from powerhouses such as Juggernaut and Skaar . Banner can also redirect the energy to increase his strength so he can lift up to 10 tons and also use it to extend his shield to protect others.</li><li>Banner made a survival kit to survey's anywhere.</li><li>Old powered taser is so strong that its effects are measured on the Richter Scale. At a 1.4, Banner was able to send Wolverine clear across the street and according to Bruce on a 6.9 it would be able to kill Wolverine.</li></ul><p>After Banner was Recruited By Shield he has shown to do Much more:</p><ul><li>Banner has Created a purification Unit that could save all Waterborne disasters for the next five years.</li><li>Banner Has made Catalytic Converter which could save countless Smoking induced cancers.</li><li>A Gamma Fracker As well.</li><li>Banner has designed a suit, but it's maximum capabilities are unknown, it is for one known that it helps resist huge amount of pressure.</li><li>Banner also has constructed a contact lens which allows him to operate it like a computer, though thus far it has only been seen to allow banner t view his physical status.</li><li>And since unlike the hulk, Banner can't breath underwater, the suit has a built in devise that enables Banner to breath on oxygen less environments.</li><li>The Suit allows Banner to survive Absolute Zero temperature.</li></ul><h2>Hulk's Incarnations</h2><p>Bruce Banner's psyche is fragmented and fractured due to years of repression, made worse by the altered genetics he was born with as well as the irradiation from the gamma bomb accident. The incarnation that are listed below only show thous Hulks who psychically manifested or appeared in banners mind long enough for one to know there identities, there are a lot of other Hulk that have appeared frozen in banners mind a place which resembles a cave, however we don't know what they represent or who they are.</p><h3>Bruce Banner</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2420913\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1945812807882\" data-width=\"406\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 406px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2420913\"><img alt=\"Bruce Banner\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" data-width=\"535\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg 406w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bruce Banner\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420913-406px_hulk13.jpg 406w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" data-width=\"535\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bruce Banner</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Banners personality usually fluctuates over time, considering that he leads a very strange life style. Whether he likes it or not, Bruce has been influenced by the jade Giant countless times. At one point Banner even believed that the hulk was nothing more than a mindless monster. This didn't stop him from perusing happiness and for a time he did manage to be at peace with himself, but eventually he was forced to<em> technically</em> commit suicide by giving his personality up to the incredible Hulk when he had realized that no matter how hard he tried, he could never really achieve happiness. This lead to the creation of The Mindless version of the green skin. ( nightmare played a huge role here). When Banner eventually came back his personality had changed drastically. Despite the fact that this was the time where a more sinister hulk had emerged (joe Fixit), Banner still remained hopeful for the future. Banner, as a man of science, and as a man who had suffered a lot, believed that all of his pain had meaning, meaning that he would never stop resisting his urge to finely <em>end it all</em>. This was proven when Mercy, an alien who granted suicidal people death, had senses Banners depression and had attempted to kill him, believing that she was doing him a favor. Bruce however, stood his ground and didn't give in. This new attitude had allowed Bruce to confront the Hulk on many occasions, and had eventually given birth to a dynamic team where Hulk and Banner would work together.</p><p>Quite recently however, after rethinking king his way of life , Bruce Banner came to the conclusion that the hulk is indestructible ,meaning that he cannot be cured, therefore, he decided that it would be for the best if he stopped trying to rid himself of the jade giant and focus his energies on leaving a mark on the world with his intellect. Therefore, he joined shield with a much more confident and happy attitude. He still has episodes of anger, most notably when he is outclassed by other prominent scientists. It's possible that Bruce may have developed an inferiority complex due to the fact that he has been overshadowed by his alter ego for so long, which would explain his indignation when other egg-heads manage to stay one step ahead of him.</p><h3>The Savage Hulk</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2420914\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5145631067961\" data-width=\"515\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 515px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2420914\"><img alt=\"Savage Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg 515w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Savage Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg 515w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2420914-marvelage_hulk03.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Savage Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>This is the 'traditional' Hulk personality.

This Hulk typically only wants to be left alone. This is one of the most powerful incarnations of the hulk. The savage Hulks strength is near-limitless, but at a calm state he can lift up to 100 tons. In appearance, The savage Hulk is a giant heavily muscled ape like creature.

Working with Banner's intelligence and cooperation, Hulk took control of the planet Sakaar, bringing peace to the land, marrying and even conceiving two children, Skaar and Hiro-Kala. After his kingdom was demolished, he returned to Earth to wage war on the Illuminati. The Green Scar is a very skilled fighter since on Sakaar he used various weapons as a gladiator in the arena. This particular version of the hulk also works with banner, and they use many strategies to bring down his opponents, which makes him a much more formidable foe and a great leader. The Green scar or The world War Hulk has displayed his brute force through many feats, he is by far the strongest hulk there has ever been, He was able to defeat the Fantastic Four, the X-men/X-force (simultaneously), the members of the illumination (although Black Bolt was revealed to be a skrull), Red Hulk, the unstopable Juggernaut, the Sentry himself and he even held planet Sakaar from falling apart with brute strength.</p><h3><b>World Breaker Hulk</b></h3><p>When this Hulk reaches a certain level of anger, he enters world breaker mode.

This version of the Hulk had children with his cousin, resulting in inbreed children. When Logan is unable to pay a months protection on time, Hulk tells his children to kill Logan's family. When Logan finds out what happened he kills all of Hulks children and then fights Banner himself. The fight results in Banner's death.</p><p>This version of the Hulk seems to have little in common with the earth-616 version. Like the ultimate version of the Hulk, this one also practices cannibalism.</p><h3><b>Larval Universe (Earth-8311)</b></h3><p>In this universe, Hulk is turned into a rabbit named Hulk Bunny.</p><h3><b>Marvel 1602 (Earth-311)</b></h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3217060\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1893939393939\" data-width=\"264\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 264px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3217060\"><img alt=\"Hulk Bunny SMASH!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg 264w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk Bunny SMASH!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/12/124022/3217060-1793032551-Hulk_.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" data-width=\"264\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk Bunny SMASH!</figcaption></figure><p>In this universe, David Banner is the adviser of King James when he inherited the throne. He was given the task to kill Sir Nicolas Fury.

The Hulk in this reality is actually <a href=\"/mystique/4005-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1469\">Mystique</a> impersonating the Hulk.</p><h3><b>What If? (Earth-774)</b></h3><p>In this version where the Hulk has the intellect of Bruce Banner, he was able to live a normal life and eventually got married to Betty Ross. He also helps Mr. Fantastic on his research on returning Ben Grimm in his normal state. They were successful and Ben's transformation resulted in the Fantastic Four disassembling. With the help of <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Professor X</a>, they created a machine more powerful than <a href=\"/cerebro/4055-15073/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15073\">Cerebro</a> which they used to defeat Galactus.

(World War Hulk)</b></h3><p>In this reality, the satellite bombardment that stopped the Sentry/WWH fight destroyed Manhattan and all of the heroes within its range. The island is now a wasteland, containing too much residual radiation for anyone to enter. Bruce Banner survived and because of the Hulk he is immune to the radiation surrounding him. He has buried what bodies he could find and is setting a grave for himself when the Vision finds him. Vision enlists Hulk in fighting for the resistance against the Skrulls, who've invaded all aspects of life on Earth. A surprise attack lays waste to the resistance fighters, but Hulk again survives. The Silver Surfer responds to a beacon set off by Hulk and the Hulk forces the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a> to summon Galactus to destroy the world, the Skrulls, and himself. Reluctantly, the Surfer obliges and Galactus arrives to consume the new Skrull home-world. Again, Hulk is the only living thing to survive Galactus' onslaught. Galactus is in need of a new herald and offers to wipe the Hulk's memories away, granting him the Power Cosmic. The Hulk becomes the World Breaker, the \"mightiest\" herald of Galactus.</p><h3><b>Earth-</b>70105 (Bullet Points)</h3><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2490515\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5355086372361\" data-width=\"521\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 521px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2490515\"><img alt=\"Bullet Points\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg 521w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bullet Points\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg 521w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33023/2490515-bullet_points.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bullet Points</figcaption></figure><p>Doctor Banner felt personally responsible for <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a>'s transformation, having been one of the original inventors of the Gamma Bomb.

The character went through some changes during the transition from comics to the television. For instance Bruce Banner was renamed to David Banner and the Hulk was far weaker and less bulky. The name change was due to a combination of Universal believing that Bruce sounded like a \"gay name\" and the creator of the series, Kenneth Johnson, desired to honor his late son by renaming Banner after him. The de-powering of Hulk was most likely due to the restrictions of budget and relatively poor special effects of the time.

The series ran for two seasons before being cancelled.</p><h4>Marvel Future Avengers</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437278\" data-ratio=\"0.55946791862285\" data-width=\"1278\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7437278\"><img alt=\"Hulk in Future Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 1278w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk in Future Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 1278w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7437278-hulk%20future.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk in Future Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Hulk appears as a major character in the Japanese anime series <em>Marvel Future Avengers</em>, voiced by Kenichiro Matsuda in the Japanese original and by Fred Tatasciore in the English dub.</p><h4><a href=\"/marvels-spiderman/4075-716/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-716\">Marvel's Spider-Man</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7370567\" data-ratio=\"0.59615384615385\" data-width=\"520\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.6%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7370567\"><img alt=\"Hulk teams with Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 520w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk teams with Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 520w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/7370567-halloween%20moon.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk teams with Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>The Hulk guest-stars in the episode \"Halloween Moon,\" with Bruce Banner voiced by Kevin Shinick and the Hulk again voiced by Fred Tatasciore.

Five years after Thanos' victory, the Avengers reunite after learning that time travel may provide a way to gain the lost Infinity Stones and resurrect all those who Thanos killed. The heroes eventually meet up with Banner, who has now morphed into his Professor Hulk persona, which combines Banner's intelligence with the Hulk's raw power. Due to this new evolution, the Hulk is no longer feared or hated, and is indeed shown to be popular and well-liked. The Professor agrees to help his former teammates construct a time travel device, which they use to travel back to various points in the timeline.</p><p>Professor Hulk is sent back to 2012 during the events of the first <em>Avengers</em> movie, where he is tasked with getting the <a href=\"/time-gem/4055-57126/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57126\">Time Stone</a> from the <a href=\"/ancient-one/4005-2212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2212\">Ancient One</a>. After persuading the Ancient One to entrust him with the Time Stone by mentioning his association with Steven Strange, the Professor returns to the present. Realizing that he is the only one strong enough to wield all six Infinity Stones without being killed by the Gamma rays they give off, the Professor is ultimately the one to use them to bring back Thanos' victims. This miracle comes with a cost, as the Professor's body is burned and weakened as a result. Despite his injuries, the Professor takes part in the final battle against Thanos' army.</p><h3>Animated Movies</h3><h4>Ultimate Avengers</h4><figure data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2274257\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.56338028169014\" data-width=\"852\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 852px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2274257\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 852w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 852w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/6/68616/2274257-133.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>The Hulk appears as a major character in <a href=\"/ultimate-avengers/4025-131/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-131\"><em>Ultimate Avengers</em> </a>and <a href=\"/ultimate-avengers-2/4025-151/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-151\"><em>Ultimate Avengers 2</em></a>, voiced by Michael Massee as Banner and by Fred Tatasciore in his Hulk form.

Arguably the most endearing piece of merchandise has been the \"Hulk Hands,\" which debuted for the original 2003 Ang Lee <em>Hulk</em> film, and have been reissued for <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, <em>The Avengers </em>and<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, as well as the <em>Avengers Assemble</em> and<em> Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.</em> cartoons.</p><h4>Marvel Legends</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6809182\" data-ratio=\"1.0980392156863\" data-width=\"816\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 816px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6809182\"><img alt=\"From ToyBiz (top) and Hasbro (below)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" data-width=\"874\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg 816w\"><noscript><img alt=\"From ToyBiz (top) and Hasbro (below)\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6809182-hulk%20legends.jpg 816w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\" data-width=\"874\"></noscript></a><figcaption>From ToyBiz (top) and Hasbro (below)</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Hulk was featured in ToyBiz's very first Marvel Legends wave back in 2002.

Thor was born centuries ago in a cave in <a href=\"/norway/4020-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55828\">Norway</a>. Once Thor was weened, <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a> brought him to Asgard where he was raised to be the God of Thunder and heir to the throne. As the Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor commands the thunder, the lightning the wind and all the elements of the storm with his hammer <a href=\"../../mjolnir/18-40971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mjolnir</a>, which was forged from the legendary, indestructible Asgardian metal; <a href=\"../../uru/18-40970/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uru</a>. Mjolnir gives Thor the power of flight and helps him channel, focus or amplify his own godly elemental powers. Though the hammer is quite heavy by mortal standards, It can only be lifted by those deemed worthy to do so, regardless of the would-be wielder’s physical strength. After centuries of defending Asgard from its enemies, Thor became too proud and grew headstrong. It was because of this that he was banished to <a href=\"/midgard/4020-56232/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56232\">Midgard</a> (Earth) by his father to teach him some needed humility. Made mortal and given the form of the handicapped human doctor <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Donald Blake</a>, Thor learned what it was like to be small and frail and how to be humble and truly noble despite being mortal. When in his mortal guise of Dr. Blake he is able to transform into his true godly form by striking his walking stick (actually Mjolnir in disguise) upon any solid surface causing the transformation that changes him into Thor and his walking stick into his hammer Mjolnir.

They first traveled to Nastrond, where they pulled one of Hakurei's scales from his hide, which would turn the blade of the sword unbreakable. From there, they went to <a href=\"/jotunheim/4020-57502/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57502\">Jotunheim</a> to take one of Gnori's feathers so that the sword would be light. Later they traveled to the deserts of Jennia, where they had to find a jewel which would keep the balance of the sword. After that, Loki appears in front of them and tells about <a href=\"/karnilla/4005-7198/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7198\">Karnilla</a>'s plan of attacking Asgard, they decided that Thor would continue the quest, while Balder, Loki and Sif would travel to Asgard and tell Odin about the incoming attack. Thor finds the lake of Lilitha, from where he should draw a small vial of water to keep to sword pure, but he discovers that the water has became sand, and so he thinks he has failed and even thus he fills his water-skin with the sand and returns to Asgard. When he arrives on Asgard, the gods are in the middle of a battle with the forces of Nornheim. As Karnilla sees her army being defeated, she shots and arrow through Thor's body and kills him. When Odin arrives at this scenery he takes the water-skin filled with sand and sheds it over the body of Thor, and when one of Sif's tears touches the sand, it becomes water once again and brings Thor back to life. One month later, the sword, now called Svadren, is given to Balder, the brave.</p><h3>Earthbound &amp; Discovery</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1550117\" data-ratio=\"1.2069892473118\" data-width=\"372\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 372px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1550117\"><img alt=\"Thor's original costume.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg 372w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor's original costume.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1550117-thor31.jpg 372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" data-width=\"530\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor's original costume.</figcaption></figure><p>Odin, Thor’s father, believed that he needed to be taught the meaning of humility. To accomplish this lesson, Odin put Thor’s mind and soul in the body of a handicapped mortal human named Doctor Donald Blake. He also erased Thor’s memories so he had no recollection of his actual godly identity. At some point after Odin had combined the essences of Thor and Blake, Blake went on vacation to the country of Norway where he saw aliens arrive in a scouting party. He fled to a cave when he saw that they had noticed him. When he saw a staff on the ground he was unaware that it was the mystical hammer of Thor himself and he smacked it against a rock and he was transformed into Thor the God of Thunder and Lightning.</p><p>From then on Thor lived his life with an alter ego. He was Donald Blake the mortal doctor who owned his private practice and he was also Thor the God of Thunder and Lightning who defeated aliens. He fell in love with a woman named Jane Foster and became one of Earths mightiest heroes. However Thor had forgotten about his evil step brother Loki who became immediately interested in Thor and Donald when he noticed the return of the Thunder God. He constantly attacked Earth over the years in order to defeat Thor once and for all. Loki was actually the creator of many of Thor’s earlier nemesis such as: The Wrecking Crew, The Absorbing Man, and also the Destroyer. Because of Loki's constant attacks, Thor was forced to seek out help from others which eventually led to the creation of “The Avengers”.</p><p>When Thor falls in love with Jane Foster he disobeyed his father by falling in love with mortal women. He refused to return to Asgard for a number of years which caused many problems between him and his father. It was revealed to Thor that his natural mother was the Elder Goddess Gaea hence why he was always so fond of the planet. Over the years the number of enemies that Thor had to encounter increased tenfold and instead of simply being a part-time protector of Earth he began to take residence there and was absent from Asgard for quite some time in his attempts to defend the planet.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192564\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2192564\"><img alt=\"A godly bout.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A godly bout.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 640w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2192564-hercules_vs_thor___cropped_kirby_cover_thor__126_color_lrg.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A godly bout.</figcaption></figure><p>Thor on occasion would meet with the Greek God Hercules, who eventually became his good friend and greatest rival. Their battles and contests of strength and hand-to-hand combat are legendary from Asgard to Olympus to even Earth itself. They are quite evenly-matched and the majority of their battles/contests have ended either in a draw or with no clear winner, though each has bested the other from time to time on the rarest of occasions.</p><p>After many heroic deeds performed by Thor, Odin finally allowed him to have a relationship with Jane Foster... if she passed a trial that he himself created. She ultimately failed the test and was returned to Earth, so she would be able to love once more one day.

It was revealed that a villain named <a href=\"/price/4005-25291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25291\">Price</a> had developed a machine called the Worldengine, which allowed him to manipulate the World Tree's power.

Thor realized that he was wrong all the time, so he restored Asgard to its rightful place and undid all the timeline via time travel.</p><h3>Ragnarok</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2066281\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5414634146341\" data-width=\"410\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2066281\"><img alt=\"Thor finds Mjolnir broken\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg 410w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor finds Mjolnir broken\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2066281-page_018.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor finds Mjolnir broken</figcaption></figure><p>Thor, <a href=\"/sif/4005-7200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7200\">Sif</a>, <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Amora</a>, <a href=\"/balder/4005-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\">Balde</a>r and <a href=\"/warriors-three/4060-33600/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-33600\">The Warriors Three</a> visit Mir-Krul to pay their respects and mourn the loss of Eitri and his brother, the eldest and greatest smiths in Nidavellir. While they are in the tomb of the dead dwarves, a loud sound, like thunder, is heard by all in attendance. As the tomb begins to fall apart due to the sound, Thor decides to investigate the source. As soon as he flies off to investigate, he is struck by a powerful lightning bolt which sends him crashing back to the ground. A flying barge appears in the sky with Loki, <a href=\"/fenris-wolf/4005-41946/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41946\">Fenris the Wolf,</a> <a href=\"/ulik/4005-12323/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12323\">Ulik the Invincible</a>, and <a href=\"/hyrm/4005-31882/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31882\">Hyrm the Giant</a>.

Fenris and Ulik descend from the barge and begin their assault. Thor fights both Fenris and Ulik simultaneously. During the fight, their three hammers strike each other with such force that the surrounding environment is devastated from the impact. After the explosion, Thor realizes that Mjolnir has been shattered. Loki uses this opportunity to fire a powerful blast to kill Thor. The blast drives Thor deep into the ground and underwater, where the <a href=\"/midgard-serpent/4005-14471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14471\">Midgard Serpent</a> attempts to swallow him whole. Thor uses his last strength to teleport himself to New York to seek aid from the Avengers. Fortunately Iron Man and Captain America are at the location of Thor’s arrival.</p><p>After resting and a change of attire, Thor, along with his old allies form the Avengers, <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> and <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, journeyed to Asgard. It was a uneasy team since the three Avengers had not seen each other after their falling-out when Thor had send Asgard to earth. When the three arrived in Asgard, they found it in ruins. The Bifrost Bridge shattered and the surrounding environment decimated as well. As they search the ruins for survivors and clues, Hyrm busts through a wall along with Loki, Fenris and Ulik. Loki mocks Thor and another battle begins. Iron Man fights Hyrm, while Thor fights Fenris and Ulik with some aid from Captain America. Loki watches the battle from above. Ulik and Hyrm are killed in the battle. When the Avengers start to gain the upper hand, Loki decide join the battle. Thor lunges at Loki and starts to beat him and Fenris at the same time. Loki, badly beaten, decides to retreat and his minions follow him. As the Avengers check themselves for major injuries, a song is heard and Thor recognizes it as a funeral song. When the trio goes to investigate, they find a funeral service for Balder. <a href=\"/harokin/4005-30867/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30867\">Harokin the Bardbarian</a> tells Thor about how Balder was killed in battle.

Thor tells Captain America and Iron Man that he must face the upcoming battle alone and they should return to Earth. He then teleports both of them back to Earth despite their protests.

He finds Volstagg of the Warriors Three there, hiding in the ruins. Thor is surprised to find Volstagg is skinny and frail looking, a shadow of his former self. Volstagg tells Thor how Alfheim was attacked and how Fandral and Hogun met their death. Thor gives Volstagg a weapon and asks him to join his army. Volstagg happily agrees to join Thor and redeem himself. Thor and his troops continue their journey across the lands and find many casualties of the war, including <a href=\"/kurse/4005-12330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12330\">Kurse</a> and <a href=\"/vidar/4005-32047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32047\">Vidar</a>, Thor’s brother. As Thor and his troops move on to Vanaheim, they hear a howl which Volstagg believes to be a wolf, but Thor correctly identifies as the battle cry of Fenris. They find that Vanaheim is under attack and Fenris soon reveals himself, now much bigger and stronger. Thor attacks Fenris , while the rest of his troops attempt to aid the army of Vanaheim. <a href=\"/valkyrie/4005-6809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6809\">Brunhilde</a> is killed in battle after being hit by a blast from <a href=\"/durok/4005-50209/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50209\">Durok the Demolisher</a> and Sif rushes to help her. Thor sees Durok approach Sif while he is battling Fenris and becomes enraged. He ties Fenris up with chains and hurls him at Durok and then he rushes to Sif’s side. After Thor and Sif are briefly reunited, he goes on to battle Durok. He kills Durok by using his godly energy to blast him. Before he is able to get a moment’s rest, Fenris breaks the chain Thor had used to tie him up. Thor readies himself to battle Fenris again when a powerful bolt of lightning strikes Fenris Wolf. The Lightning had come from Beta Ray Bill, Thor’s oath brother and an ally of Asgard. Bill uses his enchanted hammer, Stormbreaker to savagely strike Fenris until the wolf is nothing but bones. The rest of Loki’s army witness this and flee from the battlefield. Thor thanks Bill for his assistance and he orders Volstagg to count the dead and prepare a funeral pyre for Brunhilde. Later in the day, Thor and Bill discuss about the current events and the future plans. Thor tells Bill he must leave to seek wisdom and he places Bill in charge. Thor addresses the troops and tells them he has to leave but he is leaving Bill in charge, so they should follow and obey Bill as they have followed him. He then departs from Vanaheim on a chariot drawn by <a href=\"/toothgnasher/4005-22293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22293\">Toothgnasher</a> and <a href=\"/toothgrinder/4005-26372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26372\">Toothgrinder</a>. He travels to Hildstalf in search of answers. He gets to the edge of a cliff and begins to reminisce and mourn the loss of his friends and family until a ghost appears and speaks to him. The ghost is the embodiment of the <a href=\"/the-odin-force/4015-35070/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-35070\">Odin Force</a>. It takes the form of a young boy with two ravens, <a href=\"/hugin/4005-32772/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32772\">Hugin</a> and Mugin, perched on his shoulders. The Odin Force tells Thor that in order to truly become a god and gain wisdom, he must go through rituals and sacrifices similar to the ones his father, Odin, went through. Thor is told that he can’t walk a path already taken and simply repeat what his father did, he must go beyond Odin’s rituals and sacrifices.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023210\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"1018\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1018px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2023210\"><img alt=\"Free from the cycle of Ragnarok, Thor ascends to a higher state\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 1018w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 640w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Free from the cycle of Ragnarok, Thor ascends to a higher state\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 1018w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2023210-thor_odinson__earth_616__005.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Free from the cycle of Ragnarok, Thor ascends to a higher state</figcaption></figure><p>At the Well of Mimir where Odin sacrificed one of his eyes for wisdom, Thor sacrifices both his eyes. The Odin Force gives Thor Hugin and Mugin to act as his eyes. Next, Thor goes to a branch of <a href=\"../../yggdrasil-the-world-tree/34-55875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yggdrasil</a>, where Odin hung himself for nine days until he was at the brink of death, a sacrifice made to gather the knowledge of the runes. Thor hangs himself, as his father did before him, until he dies and wakes up in Hel. Hela attempts to claim his soul, but the spirit of Odin stops her and protects him. Thor wakes again, but now he is in the presence of the powerful celestial beings known as <a href=\"/those-who-sit-above-in-shadow/4060-56155/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56155\">Those Who Sit Above In Shadow</a>. They tell Thor they have been watching him and that his deeds have made him worthy of their notice and he has earned their blessing. Thor tells them that he is able to see through them and he knows how they watch the Asgardian life and death cycle and feed off it. They tell Thor that they know all outcomes, past, present and future and there is nothing he can do to stop them. Thor tells them they are wrong then he returns to Hildstalft to find that Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder have been killed by Loki. The Odin Force appears to Thor once again and asks him how he feels. Thor says he feels calm and refreshed and he will put a stop to Those Who Sit Above In Shadow. Thor then teleports to Valhalla, there he finds that Loki has rebuilt it in his own image. <a href=\"/mangog/4005-12345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12345\">Mangog</a> becomes aware of Thor’s presences and tries to attack him, but Thor easily dispatches the beast. Thor calls out to Loki to face him, and Loki answers.</p><p>Loki summons trolls to attack Thor but they fall easily before Thor’s new found might. Thor pulls off Loki’s head from his body, essentially decapitating him, but still keeps him alive. He carries the severed head with him as he goes to seek out Surtur. When Thor finds Surtur, he asks him to repair the broken Mjolnir and in return he will create a path to Valhalla and Vanaheim for Surtur to attack without interference from Thor. Surtur accepts and reforges the hammer and Thor keeps to his word. He creates a path for Surtur and his army to march to Valhalla and Vanaheim. Bill fights against Surtur’s forces but Thor teleports him away, telling him that he cannot allow Bill die for his people. Thor teleports to the Tapestry of Fate with the intent to destroy so he can bring about the end the cycle of Ragnarok. Before he is able to destroy it, Those Who Sit Above In Shadow appear to him. They beg him not to destroy it and they make him an offer to join them, to become a god of the gods. Thor refuses and smashes the loom behind the tapestry, ending the cycle of Ragnarok once and for all. Thor, with his mission now accomplished, decides to rest and breathe deep the slumber of the gods.He also is so powerful that he can destroy Galaxys</p><p> </p><h3><b>Reborn</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064466\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064466\"><img alt=\"Thor: Reborn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor: Reborn\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064466-the_mighty_thor__2_.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor: Reborn</figcaption></figure><p>One night above <a href=\"../../oklahoma/34-55803/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oklahoma</a>, Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, mysteriously fell from the sky and crashed to Earth. This occurrence didn't go unnoticed by either the local residents or the federal authorities. Soon, scores of people descended on the site where the hammer laid and attempted to pick it up. None of them succeeded, though many were injured in their attempts, until, of course, Donald Blake walked straight up to the hammer and lifted it with ease before vanishing along with the hammer and emerging in a strange void where he encountered Thor. The two spoke at length. Thor refused to return to Earth, saying that he’d ended the cycle of Ragnarok, and his return would only cause turbulence and destruction. Blake countered, telling Thor that since he’d ended the cycle, he could return without bringing back the horrors of endless war. Thor realized, while being attacked by creatures in the void, reawakened his love of life and made the decision to return to Earth. He is then transported to Earth in the form of Donald Blake. After finding his way to a small motel in a small, Oklahoma town where he found he could transform into Thor and back into Donald Blake at will, though of course there would still be a massive crash of lightning.</p><p>Thor travels to a large, empty field and raises a titanic piece of land into the sky, bringing back the kingdom of Asgard in all its glory atop the landmass.

Thor later encounters an emotional man on a bridge and realizes it is <a href=\"/heimdall/4005-3508/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3508\">Heimdall</a>. He releases Heimdall from his mortal form and takes him back to Asgard. With Heimdall’s help, Thor is able to locate more lost Asgardian souls.

Before Thor can free the prisoner, the <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\">Destroyer</a> armor appears. Thor engages the Destroyer in a furious battle. Thor, realizing that he cannot beat the Destroyer on his own, flies to the sky and releases the souls of the Asgardian prisoners so that they will aid him in the battle. As he lands back on the ground, he finds that the Destroyer has collapsed and a mysterious man stands by its fallen body. Thor demand to know who the stranger is and finds that it is <a href=\"/balder/4005-7201/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7201\">Balder the Brave</a>. Balder explains to Thor how he got summoned and trapped into <a href=\"/destroyer/4005-7940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7940\">Destroyer</a> armor. Thor goes to check on the newly released Asgardians and finds out that he has unknowingly released his half-brother Loki, now reborn as a woman.

Balder refuses to believe Loki’s words, but Loki urges Balder to ask Thor for confirmation. Balder confronts Thor about it and Thor admits that they are indeed half-brothers and he had known for ages. He explains to Balder that he and Odin had agreed to keep it a secret in order to protect Balder, since his death could trigger the start of Ragnarok. Loki appears during the discussion and says that since Balder is now aware of his heritage, the next step would be to make the news public and celebrate the coronation of Balder as a new prince of Asgard. Thor agrees and a celebration is held in honor of Balder, a new Prince of Asgard.</p><h3>Battle with Bor and Exile from Asgard</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064472\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5182291666667\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2064472\"><img alt=\"Thor vs Bor - The Final Strike\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg 384w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor vs Bor - The Final Strike\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2064472-thor__600_035.jpg 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor vs Bor - The Final Strike</figcaption></figure><p>Loki resurrected <a href=\"/bor/4005-58894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58894\">Bor</a>, father of Odin and grandfather of Thor, from the dead in the middle of a crowded city. Loki casts a spell on the newly resurrected Bor in order to make him see everyone around him as an enemy. Confused and angry, Bor attacks everything in sight. Jane Foster calls Donald Blake and tells him about the rampaging Asgardian. Donald transforms into Thor and flies to Bor’s location. Bor, believing his son Odin has been slain, continues his rampage until Thor arrives. Thor recognizes Bor’s attire as Asgardian, but he does not recognize the man as his grandfather. Thor attempts to talk to Bor and calm him down but because of Loki’s spell, Bor sees Thor as a villain and hears his words as threats. Bor rushes and attacks Thor, breaking Thor’s rib with his first strike. Thor attempts to end the battle quickly because of the innocent bystanders around. Thor hurls Mjolnir to strike at Bor and is dismayed when Bor is able to catch and lift the hammer. Bor, believing Mjolnir to be a murderer’s weapon, throws the hammer away. Thor and Bor rush at each other, continuing to battle furiously. As the battle rages on, Thor decides to call the Avengers for help believing he can’t subdue Bor by himself without killing him.

After Thor had struck the final blow, Loki and Balder appear and Balder informs Thor of Bor’s true identity. Thor approaches Bor and cradles his grandfather’s head in his arms as the fallen warrior speaks his last words. Bor expresses regret at not being able to avenge his son, but also expresses happiness at the thought of being with him in Valhalla forever. Bor dies in Thor’s arms. Thor show regret and sorrow as he tries to explain to Loki and Balder that he did not know Bor’s identity. Loki informs them that though Bor had been absent for a long time; he was and is still King of Asgard. He reminds Balder that the punishment for slaying a member of the royal family was the loss of all titles and honors and also banishment from Asgard. Balder sadly confirms that that is indeed the punishment for such a crime and that the law must come before all things.</p><p>Back at Asgard, a trial is held for Thor. Thor is found guilty and Balder passes judgement, banishing Thor from Asgard for all time. After Thor leaves Asgard, Loki tells the other Asgardians about a land that is similar to their previous home.

Apocalypse mocks him for not being properly armed.</p><p>Realizing he can't beat Apocalypse Thor retreats calming himself by saying this is an intermission, Thor travels back to Asgard and asks his father to help him. Odin refuses, and leaves. Loki comes and talks to Thor, he tells him he knows a spell that can help him, if he enchanted his axe with that spell it will cut Apocalypse. Thor thanks Loki and leaves (as he is leaving Loki is revealed to be Kang).</p><p>Thor engages The four horseman of the Apocalypse in London, after a quick fight Thor kills all of them and goes after Apocalypse. Thor engages Apocalypse again this time he slices him with Jarnbjorn, Apocalypse says Thor cheated and activates his self destruct button for his ship.</p><p>Thor later celebrates his victory drinking when Odin barges in warning Thor that he created a wrecker of worlds, and that Odin can't help him, this is his mistake to learn from.

Thor brings the news to Alex and Steve, Steve loses his cool at Wolverine who has been secretly killing threats, Wolverine says he will do what needs to be done and anyone who agrees with him should come, Thor joins him along with Rogue and Sunfire.</p><p>Wolverine's team finds Ozymandias and torture him for info, after getting the location of the Apocalypse twins they head there. Once they enter a door they realize they had been sent inside a galaxy that was completely shrunk down using Pym particles, before it sets in Thor is attacked by Sentry (now a horseman of death) who drags him to another planet many light years away, there Thor is beaten and left on an alien planet by Death Seed Sentry.</p><p>After Thor wakes up he saves the alien planet he is on by summoning an ocean from a different galaxy. He then travels back to the planet he was taken from, there he sees Wasp being overpowered by Sentry, he attacks Sentry crushing his brain, however that has no effect on Sentry, with Wasp's help Sentry is trapped inside an alien worm that has a shell hard enough to stop Wolverine from escaping.</p><p>He and Wasp leave the Microverse and head to Earth where they see Existar the celestial standing before Earth with his thump down, Thor goes to the Moon to talk to the Watcher, the Watcher tells Thor this is his fault for creating Jarbjorn.</p><p>Thor and Wasp separate, she is to destroy the Tachyon dam, and Thor to fight the Apocalypse Twins. Thor barges in on the Apocalypse twins and frees Steve Rogers and then attacks Uriel. Seeing Wanda's corpse Thor attacks Uriel knocking him down then opens a portal and forces Uriel in it, the fire in the portal burns Uriel and damages Thor's arm, he then attempts to take Jarbjorn but before he can reach it Eimin takes it.</p><p>Eimin admits that she knew all of this, but her hatred of Kang is too great and what she is doing is hyperevolition. She manages to hurt a distracted Thor takes the axe and flees with all the mutants on Earth right before Existar destroys the Earth killing all the humans.</p><p>Thor opens a portal to Asgard, as he still deals with the shock of Earth's destruction, Odin shows up and tell him that it was man's fault, they fought each other rather than unite,that that was always man's fate.</p><p>After Janet and Alex destroy the Tachyon dam Thor shows up with Kang and other villains from alternate time, when Alex asks how could Thor join with these guys, Thor responses that he tried everything and nothing worked, this was his only solution to save Earth.</p><p>Thor attacks Eimin's base to help free the remaining members of the Unity Squad, after Thor sees Eimin he attacks her brutally and attempts to cleave her with Jarbjorn. Kang stops him and tells him not to let his pride be his downfall again, Thor along with Sunfire, Wolverine, Wasp. Alex are sent back in time to stop the Apocalypse Twins.</p><p>Thor instead of fighting Sentry convinces him to help him save Earth, then he steals Jarnbjorn, after Sentry stops Existar from descending to Earth Thor attacks and injures Existar, before Thor can finish him he is attacked Deathlok who takes him inside Existar under orders from Kang.</p><p>Thor frees himself moments later and attacks Kang who is absorbing Existar's energy to gain omnipotence, Kang brushes Thor aside promising him a fight after he drinks the soul of a God.</p><h3>Thor: God of Thunder- The God Butcher</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5768546\" data-ratio=\"0.75625\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.6%\" href=\"https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5768546\"><img alt=\"Thor encounters Gorr at various points in his life\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 1600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor encounters Gorr at various points in his life\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 1600w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5768546-9073937648-19451.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor encounters Gorr at various points in his life</figcaption></figure><p>The story starts in 3 separate timelines. It flashbacks to a younger, adult Thor, where he has slayed a Frost Giant protecting a town. The corpse of a butchered God floats to the village where Thor plans to have a proper funeral for the butchered being but have his fun with the village still with mead and women. In present day, a young child on the planet Indigarr pray for Thor to bring weather to the planet as they are dying without it due to the lack of water for crops and agricultural needs. Thor comes and brings rain to the planet and creates new rivers and stays as they make him ale and tell him of how there are stories of a floating city.</p><p>The elder tells him that they are just stories and that Indigarr has no true gods. Thor is somewhat insulted when the elder tells him that what Thor said was just stories and flies away where he discovers the floating city. He explores it and discovers that is where the city's gods are, but they are all slaughtered by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gorr/4005-86617/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86617\">Gorr the God Butcher</a>. Thor is attacked by Gorr's guard dog.</p><p>In the future, Thor is king but of a broken Asgard and is the only god left. He heads out and attacks the assaulting creatures outside and says that no matter what his fate is, he will face it like a God.</p><p>In the past a young Thor challenges the God Butcher after he kills the Slav gods he was going to fight. Recalling an older encounter with a mad god who shared the Butcher's evil eyes. He is soundly defeated and barely survives the encounter with the Butcher thanks to his lightning. However after the battle he decides to face the Butcher again, who sends word for him to enter a dark cave. In the present Thor reveals that he never spoke of what happened in that cave and it may have led to the Gods lack of knowledge or preparations for the Butcher.</p><p>Future Thor has given up the fight with the God butchers and is carried away by the Black Berserkers through the ruins of Asgard, They place him down onto his throne without killing him and this angers Thor as he wants to die with honor.</p><p>Meanwhile in the present day Thor was talking to a God named Shadrak , He explained to Thor that Gorr has talked about him before and that Gorr is the God killer. He explained to Thor his Eyelids had been cut off by Gorr in an attack against his people. Thor and Shadrak travel to Omnipotence city to find information about something called Chronux. They are surprised to find the librarian knocked out. They are ambushed by the Black Berserkers who are burning the library, They defeat them and Thor then proceeds to ask the Librarian who Chronux is, Thor is surprised to find out that it is only a hidden world. Thor has to find a book talking about it, but it was burning in the ruins of the Library, Thor rushes and reads the book before it burns.</p><p>Past Thor has been captured by the Gorr and is being tortured for information about the Gods, Thor asks why he is doing it and refuses to help. Gorr gets angry and carries on torturing Thor, revealing he has tortured many gods before. The scene ends with just text of Thor screaming in Pain.</p><p>Present Thor learns the Location of Chronux and beings to travel. Future Thor has taken up the strength and attempted to fight the God Butchers to gain a warriors Death, the scene ends with future Thor being stabbed. Present Thor follows Gorr through the time pool of Chronux and arrives on a future Asgard asking 'Where is the butcher of Gods?'.</p><h3>Thor: God of Thunder- Godbomb</h3><p>Continuing from the God Butcher arc present Thor having arrived on a future Asgard expecting to find Gorr the God Butcher unexpectedly finds Old King Thor who is also shocked to see his past self. The two of them fight back the black beserkers of Gorr together who then begin to retreat. Thor asks his future self where the God Butcher is as he was right behind him, Old King Thor explains that he arrived at the same place Gorr did only he is 900 years too late.</p><p>Present and future Thor are now together on the future Asgard which is a wasteland with no Gods but Thor who Gorr left there to endlessly fight his black beserkers but would not let him die. Old King Thor explains that he is now the all-father, and that Gorr has called the black beserkers back home, for the first time in 900 years Asgard's skies are clear and the siege has stopped. Old King Thor says that they still have a chance and he goes to make himself ready for war and that the present Thor should do the same.</p><p>In the past Thor has been having nightmares of Gorr still being alive when he hears a scream in the night and goes to investigate, only to find one of Gorr's black beserkers who he engages in battle. The beserker has a crystal likely created in Chronux which causes Thor to time travel and appear in front of Gorr who welcomes him to the place Gods go to die.</p><p>Future Thor explains to his past self what happened to Asgard and how Gorr enslaved all the Gods on a blackened dead planet at the edge of space, where he is building something. He explains how he has been trapped with no hope thinking it would be his prison for eternity until present Thor showed up. He now has renewed strength from seeing himself as he once was and for the first time in centuries feels like a God again, possibly even feeling the Thor-force(Odin-Force) within him once again which he thought spent forever. The two embark on their journey for Gorr's planet.</p><p>On Gorr's planet the past Thor has been made Gorr's slave, and Gorr wants to make sure that it is him who drives the last nail in. Past Thor on Gorr's planet is reluctant to be a slave and is constantly fighting back against the black beserkers. But he is put in line by three sisters who let him know every time he fights back Gorr crucifies another God, it later turns out that these three sisters are in fact his granddaughters of the future. The slave Gods of the planet are given occasional rest and in this time they plot how to take out Gorr's God bomb that will kill every God in existence throughout time. They have built a bomb of their own out of all the unstable materials they have found and plan to destroy Gorr's bomb with it but are looking for a volunteer to do the deed. Thor of the past steps forward to be the one to do it which shocks his future granddaughters who had no idea of his identity. While they argue about who to send to destroy the bomb Thor steals it and heads towards the Godbomb. He asks for one last storm to scream with him while he dies, the skies answer and he makes it rain fire with lightning dropping from the skies taking out hordes of black beserkers. Thor hurls the unstable rock at the bomb hoping to destroy it creating an explosion that even present and future Thor feel from their ship but the Godbomb was unscathed by the attack.</p><p>Past Thor manages to get to space and boards the ship of present and future Thor riding a space shark, the three Thor’s of different eras are now united against Gorr. The fight now begins Gorr taking on all three Thor’s at once in an epic battle. Old King Thor now feels the Thor-Force within him again and releases a mighty God Blast upon Gorr sending him light years away, causing the God Butcher to feel fear for the first time. Gorr now needing more power to defeat the Gods of Thunder, orders his black beserkers to kill all the Gods to fuel the Necrosword and give him more power. The battle continues with the Thor’s fighting for the fate of all the Gods however, in the end the three Gods of Thunder fell along with their hammers. Gorr now makes ready the bomb.</p><p>With the bomb nearly ready to be triggered Gorr speaks with his wife, she explains that Gorr is the only being worthy of worship and that he is her God. This does not sit well with Gorr who proceeds to murder his wife for this, but his son witnessed the incident. Gorr’s son now not approving of what his father has become aids present Thor, he prays to him that he will kill his father and frees the other slaves. The Thor’s now return to the battle with their Mjolnir’s free, engaging Gorr once again. The God Bomb has now been triggered and the only way the Thor’s know how to stop it is to do what they do best “hit it with hammers”. Old King Thor engages Gorr and sends his Mjolnir to present Thor for him to destroy the bomb.</p><p>The God Bomb is detonating throughout time, killing every God to ever exist all at once, but at the centre of the God Bomb present Thor persevered as he was no lesser God. Using the two Mjolnir’s Thor began to absorb the blast of the bomb into himself putting his life on the line to save the Gods. Across the Universe all Gods had a vision of Thor with a hammer in each hand fighting to save them, and for a moment stretching across time every God to ever exist closed their eyes and prayed to Thor.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5881995\" data-ratio=\"1.0041797283177\" data-width=\"1914\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1914px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5881995\"><img alt=\"The Necro-Thor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px\" data-width=\"956\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 1914w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 1912w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 956w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Necro-Thor\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 1914w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 1912w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5881995-3889038785-32409.jpg 956w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px\" data-width=\"956\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Necro-Thor</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>The bomb was no more, absorbed by Thor who now wielded the power of the Necrosword for himself becoming the Necro-Thor and leaving Gorr without his power. Thor converses with Gorr explaining that the weapon was meant to kill Gods but it was also meant to be wielded by one. He proceeds to unleash a mighty blast at Gorr releasing the power of the Necrosword, with young Thor chopping his head off for good measure.</p><p>Thor died, and rose again three days later where he found his past and future selves standing over him. They explained to him that the God Butcher was dead and turned to ash and that the Necrosword was left where it fell, and Old King Thor threw the entire planet into a black hole. The Thor’s now free at last finally returned to their own timelines to face their own challenges and responsibilities.</p><h3>Old King Thor</h3><p><strong>Origin</strong></p><p>All-Father Thor's life closely parallels and is tied to it of the Thor of Earth-616, who he refers to as being his past self, to the extent that if the Earth-616 Thor were to die he would cease to exist. During the War of the Realms, Thor sacrificed his eye to get the knowledge to defeat Malekith the Accursed, and was made All-Father of Asgard - the story being recorded in a very saga.</p><p><strong>God Cop</strong></p><p>At some point, Thor left Asgard and joined Omnipotence City's Ministry of Inter-Deity Justice, becoming a enforcement officer assigned to Sun Precinct Prime. As a cosmic god cop, Thor prevented wars among various unruly pantheons and arrested gods that violated inter-pantheon laws.</p><p><strong>Reincarnations</strong></p><p>Following his tenure as a divine cop, Thor changed his form into that of a planet orbited by moons of Uru, assisting the Sorcerer Supreme Daimon Hellstrom during the 1000 Nights of Ragnarok.</p><p>Thor eventually regained his humanoid form but was left amnesiac after a psychic attack by Frost Giant assassins, wandering the frozen jungles of Jotunheim and hunted by Loki's army. However, She-Blizzard - the overall of the Frost Giant army - fell dotty with him, sparking a torrid affair that gave rise Thor's half-giant son named Woden after his father's Anglo-Saxon name, who successively had three daughters named Frigg, Ellisiv, and Atli.</p><p><strong>All-Father of Asgard</strong></p><p>Eventually, Thor returned to Asgard and inherited the facility of the All-Father from Odin, renaming it the \"Thor-Force\". Thor's brother Loki, falling back to evil, instigated the annihilation of all life on Earth out of spite; the loss of his friends and comrades causing Thor to become a stern and cynical ruler - the likeness of his father.</p><p><strong>Coming of the God-Butcher</strong></p><p>Thor's reign was disrupted when a deicidal alien liquidator named Gorr appeared, having travelled through time using the Pool of Forevers. Bonded to the traditional All-Black symbiote, Gorr manifested a horde of monsters called Black Berserkers and started a brutal campaign - capturing and enslaving every deity he found. Asgard was ransacked and its inhabitants captured or killed - Woden being slain and Thor's granddaughters being among the enslaved. Trapped in a very cycle of being beaten and brutalized but not killed by the Black Berserkers - Gorr's way of mocking him - Thor fell into despair and wished for death.</p><p>After 900 years, the Thor of Earth-616 arrived, having followed Gorr into the longer term through the Pool of Forevers. All-Father Thor's hope and fighting spirit rekindled, the 2 Thors embarked on to attack the Black World of Gorr, joined by the young Thor from Earth-616's 6th century - who had been torn from the past by Gorr using the Pool of Forevers. The three Thors battled Gorr in an endeavor to stop him from using the Godbomb to kill all gods that ever had and ever would exist, but were ultimately defeated. Crucified to a comet, All-Father Thor was sent flying into the depths of space, but freed himself and returned to Gorr's dark world, but was unable to prevent the Godbomb from detonating. Thor the Avenger bonded to the All-Black symbiote, halting Gorr's plan, and Young Thor killed the God-Butcher. All-Father Thor used the Thor-Force to purge Thor the Avenger of the All-Black symbiote and resurrect him when he succumbed to his wounds, casting Gorr's dark world into a region to stop Young Thor from claiming the symbiote-sword out of arrogance. Reunited along with his remaining family, All-Father Thor sent his past selves to their proper places within the timeline and allowed the displaced gods to settle in Asgard.</p><p><strong>Restoration of Midgard</strong></p><p>With Earth having become lifeless, Thor often visited Midgard reflecting on its barren nature and mourning its desolation. When Galactus came to devour it, Thor attempted to prevent him but was thrown into part. Realizing he couldn't defeat Galactus as he was, Thor retrieved the All-Black symbiote and bonded to that. Corrupted by the symbiote, Thor attempted to kill the Devourer of Worlds before succumbing to his injuries and fainting. Wounded during his fight with Galactus, he bled upon the planet causing flowers to grow anew. King Thor and his granddaughters subsequently did their best to cultivate the planet so the flowers and trees and other plants could thrive.</p><p>Fearing his death was near, King Thor's granddaughter Ellisiv came up with the right gift for his birthday to lift his spirits. The three thunder goddesses gathered all the bones they'll find, stardust from a comet, sap from Yggdrasil, mud from the Well of Urd, and three strands of hair from the All-Father; weaving a fancy spell of life. They created hybrids of Earth's animals, like shark-birds and zebra-flies and multi-tusked elephants. Overwhelmed by his gratitude at his granddaughters' actions, Thor used the remaining material within the cauldron to make a \"Lif\" and \"Lifthrasir\", dubbing them 'Steve' and 'Jane'.</p><p><strong>Secret Wars</strong></p><p>When the Multiverse was destroyed as a results of the Incursions, Battleworld was formed from the remnants of the destroyed realities. King Thor was among those recreated. He later joined the Thor Corps, a bunch composed of multiple men and ladies across Battleworld and God Emperor Doom's enforcers of justice. As a Thor Corps member, King Thor worked as their Lawspeaker. King Thor was first seen when the Thor Corps arrested America Chavez of Arcadia for throwing a megalodon over the Shield.</p><p>King Thor was among the Thor Corps members that showed up in Technopolis to arrest Tony Stark and Arno Stark for his or her crimes.</p><p><strong>End of your time</strong></p><p>After the restoration of the Multiverse, King Thor travelled to the sting of the cosmos to look at the tip of the universe and check out to search out some way to prevent it. He was attacked by James Howlett - who had been resurrected and indwelled by the Phoenix Force. Despite Thor being delighted to work out his old flame for the primary time in millennia, Old Man Phoenix attacked him in retaliation for bringing back the planet, revealing that Doom - who had been collecting the powers wielded by the Prehistoric Avengers - was returning to overcome it. the 2 gods' battle shook the cosmos, but Old Man Phoenix was victorious; only being stopped from killing Thor by the Phoenix Force's memories of being the All-Father's lover within the ancient past. Thor and Old Man Phoenix returned to Earth in time to avoid wasting his granddaughters from being killed, but Thor was incapacitated by Doom's Penance Stare. Logan sacrificed himself to transfer the Phoenix Force into Mjolnir, and Thor smashed Doom into New Midgard's mantle - their 99-year battle triggering earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Emerging victorious from a fissure, Thor collapsed into the Forever Sleep to recover; the Phoenix Force transferring to a brand new host and warning the Lifs and Lifthrasirs that true darkness was coming to kill all of them.</p><p><strong>War of the Realms</strong></p><p>Recalling how he had won the War of the Realms within the past, Thor prevented his granddaughters from attacking Reed Richards and Ben Grimm of the superb Four once they travelled through time to recruit him to prevent Malekith. Journeying to the past, All-Father Thor was reunited with the Thor from Earth-616 - who had lost an arm to Malekith and sacrificed one in all his eyes to Yggdrasil to get the knowledge of the way to defeat the dark elf warlord - and was pleased to work out he'd finally grown a beard. He was less pleased to work out the hot-headed and beardless Young Thor, who had been brought forward in time to reunite the trinity. Joined by Jane Foster, who became Thor again using the Mjolnir of Earth-1610, the four Thors engaged Malekith - who had bonded to the Venom symbiote in emulation of Gorr and also the ancient dark god Knull - who had created All-Black to exterminate the gods. All-Father Thor was pleasantly surprised when Young Thor was able to lift his Mjolnir so as to avoid wasting their mother from being devoured, and after Malekith was slain he offered to indicate his past self the wonders of the Golden Age of Craft Beer.</p><p><strong>The Return of Gorr</strong></p><p>As Thor rested in Asgard, he was suddenly attacked by his brother Loki possessing All-Black the Necrosword, who managed to destroy Asgard. the 2 battled, however, Loki had the favorable position as he managed to disembowel Thor. Thor tried to defeat Loki by launching him into the Sun with Mjolnir, but instead, Loki turned the Sun black. The battle moved to New Midgard. Loki resolve to finish the remaining reality, but he was unexpectedly stabbed from behind by Gorr the God-Butcher, who Loki had resurrected to kill him after he killed Thor. Thor and Gorr battled across the crumbling ruins of the cosmos, but despite Loki coming to his aid he was overwhelmed and nearly drowned within the All-Black symbiote. The Sky Lords of Indigarr came to Thor's rescue, Gorr revealing that he had transferred his consciousness into All-Black and integrated the primordial symbiote into the very fabric of the universe itself. Resolving himself to embody Ragnarok and destroy the cosmos he had sworn to shield, Thor was overwhelmed by Gorr and sucked into a cluster of supermassive black holes. However, Loki distracted Gorr by telling him of all of Thor's heroic deeds, buying Thor enough time to destroy the All-Black symbiote using the facility of the God-Tempest.</p><p>With Gorr rendered powerless and amnesiac and Loki sacrificing himself to rekindle the blackened sun, Thor sank into the Sleep of Sleeps so as to recover. Upon awakening, he left his grandaughters guilty of Midgard, giving them Mjolnir as their birthright, and sailed into the heart of entropy.</p><p> </p><h3>Infinity</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3476161\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.97355769230769\" data-width=\"832\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3476161\"><img alt=\"Thor Slaying the Builder\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 832w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor Slaying the Builder\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 832w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11111/111114407/3476161-4759657047-tumbl.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor Slaying the Builder</figcaption></figure><p>Thor is among the Avengers that joins the fight against the Builders during Infinity.

Unfortunately, the Mangog resurfaced and attacked Asgardia. Odinson stood by his father's side but they failed to stop the creature. Odinson assisted Thor in fighting the monster while his people evacuated Asgardia. In order to put an end to the Mangog, Thor fastened it to the hammer with an unbreakable chain and hurled them into the Sun. Since this action resulted in Mjolnir's destruction, Jane returned to her frail human form and passed away due to her cancer. Unwilling to let her go, Odinson attempted to channel the God Tempest to use its power to Thor with his new hammers and a golden arm, in his new look.xrevive her. Odin joined his endeavor since he had seen hesitation within Jane's own soul at the gates of Valhalla, and they were successful in bringing her back. With the destruction of Mjolnir and her inability to continue as Thor, Jane convinced Odinson to rise up and reclaim his name and identity. After Odinson works with his father to bring Jane back to life, she restarts her chemotherapy while inspiring Odinson to return to his old name, suggesting that he see what kind of Thor he can be without a hammer after witnessing her accomplishments with one. As a result, Thor returns to a variant of his more familiar look with a golden arm, using various substitute hammers until the dwarves can gather enough uru to forge a true new Mjolnir.</p><h3>War Of The Realms</h3><p>After wreaking havoc through various realms, Malekith and the Dark Council planned to the only realm left untouched, Midgard. Loki learned of this and tried to betray Malekith, but Malekith expected this and injured Loki. Loki fled to Midgard and met with Thor to warn him of Malekith's plans. After vanquishing assassin sent by Malekith, Thor forced Loki to take him to Malekith, who was in Jotunheim. Loki then left Thor behind to face off with Frost Giants.</p><p>Malekith and the Dark Council then invaded Midgard and took over much of the planet after overwhelming its defenders through sheer numbers. After the defenders retreated to Avengers Mountain, All-Mother Frigga sent a team of heroes to rescue Thor.

That was when he learned that his parents were alive and were being held captive by Malekith at Stonehenge, which Malekith surrounded with a magic barrier that only Thor could pass through; if anyone else passed through the barrier, Odin and Frigga would die.</p><p>After sacrificing his left eye and the last remaining piece of Mjolnir, Thor learned how to fight Malekith: gather more Thors. So, the Thing and Mr. Fantastic went back and forward through time to gather past and future versions of Thor to aid him. Jane Foster also helped Thor by transforming into Thor once again using the remnant of Earth-1610 Mjolnir. The four Thors struggled against Malekith after he had used dark magic to transform the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom symbiote</a> into a weapon. Thor was finally able to defeat Malekith by reforging Mjolnir and proving himself to be worthy to wield it due to the struggle to become worthy. For proving instrumental in defeating Malekith and saving Midgard, Odin stepped down as the Asgardians' All-Father and appointed Thor as the new All-Father.</p><p> </p><h3> </h3><h4>The Black Winter Saga</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7252495\" data-ratio=\"1.5406562054208\" data-width=\"701\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 701px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7252495\"><img alt=\"All-Father Thor, as the Herald of Galactus.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" data-width=\"623\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg 701w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg 623w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All-Father Thor, as the Herald of Galactus.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg 701w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11133/111333401/7252495-thor-herald-1201760.jpeg 623w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" data-width=\"623\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All-Father Thor, as the Herald of Galactus.</figcaption></figure><p>Gathering Galactus' former heralds, Thor was informed by the Silver Surfer that the Black Winter had destroyed the 6th iteration of the universe, and if Galactus was going to be powerful enough to oppose it, he had to consume five special planets.

According to his father, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/odin/4005-3507/\">Odin</a>, Thor is not at full potential yet but when he is, Thor will be even more powerful than he is. Thor has been stated to be the most powerful being on Earth and one of the most powerful heroes in the Marvel Universe. He's often stated to be the heavy hitter on the Avengers team alongside his rival the Hulk.</p><h4><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong></h4><p>Thor is physically the strongest of the <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/4060-41205/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41205\">Norse Gods</a>, being the son of Odin and Gaea, and as such is the God of Strength. His strength is incalculable in the sense that the upper limit, if one exists, is unknown and there seems to be nearly anything he can't do through applying his strength. Thor has physically overpowered and defeated the strongest of foes including the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\">Abomination</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/gladiator/4005-4653/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4653\">Gladiator</a>, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">the Thing</a>, even when he had become <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Angrir</a>, and Thor nearly killed him with one strike. Thor has stalemated the Savage <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>, despite the latter's increasing strength due to rage and the struggle going on for hours, and stalemated Hercules in several of contests, and the two even once set the planet they were arm-wrestling on out of orbit. One of Thor's greatest feats was when he lifted the <a href=\"/midgard-serpent/4005-14471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14471\">Midgard Serpent</a>, which was so large it could wrap itself several times around the Earth and crush it in its grasp. Thor can destroy planets with his strikes, and in a battle with Gorr destroyed countless worlds with life-ending blows, also when he struck <a href=\"/beta-ray-bill/4005-6139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6139\">Beta Ray Bill</a> so hard that he destroyed the planet they were on, which is why he holds back his vast strength to ensure he does not greatly harm his opponents or the area in which they are in. Nevertheless, Thor can effortlessly press over 1,000,000 tons, and has strength that rivals beings such as Hercules and Gladiator.</p><h4><strong>Invulnerability</strong></h4><p>Thor’s physiology is a product of his half-Asgardian/ half-Elder God heritage grants him a level of invulnerability that is not common amongst those of his race. Thor has been shown to be immune to all human diseases as well as its poisons and toxins. Thor is also immune to electrocution and radiation poisoning and his metabolism is so great that it is nearly impossible for Thor to become drunk except for when he imbibes alcoholic beverages of godly origin. His durability has enabled him to survive blasts from the Celestials, and fight on until finally being subdued, and a blast from <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a> . He has also sat in the core of the Sun, and he is immune to temperature extremes. He does not require air, and has been able to withstand planet-shattering attacks, he also withstood the weight of a score of planets, and much more. Though Thor is one of the most invulnerable of Marvel's heroes, he is not immune to all forms of harm and can be defeated by a being whose power matches or exceeds his own, or by high order magic manipulation.</p><h4><strong>Superhuman Stamina</strong></h4><p>Due to his god-like physiology, Thor has a much higher level of endurance than that of humans and most meta-humans. Thor's physiology grants him the ability to perform at his physical peak without tiring for very long periods of time. Thor’s body, unlike that of humans, produces almost no fatigue toxins. Thor has displayed his superhuman stamina in a number of situations- he once continually battled an army of Frost Giants for 9 months. Thor has been seen (from time to time) growing tired after particularly long and strenuous battles, including times when he possessed the Odin-force. Recently, he has been seen sleeping more often when the day ends. This implies he does indeed require rest to rejuvenate himself, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that sleep is luxury, rather than something he requires daily.</p><h4><strong>Self Sustenance</strong></h4><p>Thor and those of his race can go periods of time without food, drink and rest. Odin himself has stated however that with no food the Gods would not survive and Thor has been sleeping on many occasions in his home in Asgard suggesting that currently Thor's body does produce fatigue toxins and thus, he must rest from time to time. Thor himself has displayed the ability to survive in a vacuum of space for an extended period of time. Thor’s unique physiology allows him to survive in space without the need for any equipment due to the fact that his musculature is much denser to that of a human being.</p><h4><strong>Energy Perception and Manipulation</strong></h4><p>Thor has the ability to change his vision or shift one's brain waves to psychically see or detect the presence of a certain type (or numerous types) of energy, and as a powerful energy, manipulator bend those energies to his will. Thor can perceive the Universe as pure energy and become one with it.</p><h4><strong>Superhuman Speed</strong></h4><p>Thor has the ability to fly at great speed far beyond the abilities of a human being. He is often seen flying at very fast speeds and has even kept up with the Silver Surfer. He has flown several times faster than light on multiple occasions. Though Thor’s running speed has never been accurately measured, though he has been seen moving at speeds faster than the finest human athlete.</p><h4><strong>Healing Factor</strong></h4><p>As stated previously, Thor is not invulnerable to all harm and it is possible to injure him. But due to Thor’s unique physiology, he is able to heal from most injuries much faster than a human being could. This healing factor is said to be much stronger than that of the typical Asgardian God. Thor also has the ability to regenerate missing limbs through the use of Mjolnir or the Odin Force (which he currently does not possess, only a small portion that resides within his hammer).</p><h4><strong>Superhuman Senses</strong></h4><p>Though rarely displayed Thor possesses some god-like senses. He's able to see as far as the edge of the solar system and track objects traveling faster than the speed of light. He can also hear cries from the other side of the planet. He can see molecules/atoms and colors/wavelengths invisible to humans.</p><h4><strong>Longevity</strong></h4><p>It is a common misconception that Thor and the other Gods of Asgard are truly immortal. Thor and the other members of his race do age but at a rate so slow that to other beings they give the appearance of immortality. Thor has been stated to be thousands of years old which makes his life span incomparable to that of the human beings which he protects. When the Asgardians consume the Golden Apples that are cultivated by the goddess Idunn, they are able to maintain themselves in their physical prime.</p><h4><strong>Weather Control</strong></h4><p>Thor as the god of thunder and son of Gaea was born with the natural ability to control weather since birth. Thor normally relies on Mjölnir to control the weather with a devastating degree and release blasts of lightning. Mjolnir allows him better more precise control over his powers and allows him to better regulate his power output, and can act as a shortcut to access his natural powers. This is compared to using his powers without Mjolnir which seemingly requires more effort to summon and are more raw and unregulated in their nature. He is able to summon huge storms, rain, and lightning from the sky and also creating weather where it normally isn't. He has also the ability to create unnatural weather like fire rain on a barren planet. Thor can also discharge lightning bolts from his hands that are lethal and raw in power, also engulfing his hands in lightning to amp his punches.</p><h4><strong>Earth Control</strong></h4><p>After Thor was resurrected he came to terms with the fact that he was the son of the Elder Goddess Gaea and realized his ability to control the Earth and has displayed this power by creating very powerful earthquakes. Thor also displayed this ability when he created a chasm in Africa between two different areas to prevent the enemies of one side from entering the territory of the other.</p><h3><ins><strong>Mjolnir</strong></ins></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710763\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4206081081081\" data-width=\"592\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 592px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710763\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg 592w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg 592w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/710763-mjolnir_melts.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Thor wielded one of the most powerful weapons in all of the Marvel Universe; the hammer called <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a>. Mjolnir was forged of the metal <a href=\"/uru/4055-40970/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40970\">Uru</a>, by <a href=\"/eitri/4005-28902/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28902\">Eitri</a> the troll, for Odin and was given to Thor by him and is extremely durable and is said to be stronger than the virtually indestructible metal <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">Adamantium</a>. Mjolnir was granted mystical energies by Odin himself and has been shown to be able to survive to be in extreme environments such as the heart of the sun itself and energy blasts that could have destroyed an entire galaxy. When in the hands of someone as strong as Thor, it impacts with sufficient force to \"destroy mountains\" and has proven capable(on multiple occasions) of harming cosmic entities. Mjolnir gives Thor many mystical abilities that are not common among those of his race. Some of the abilities that the hammer grants Thor are:</p><h4><b>Weather Control</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5882783\" data-ratio=\"0.72\" data-width=\"625\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 625px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5882783\"><img alt=\"A young Thor without Mjolnir causing the skies to rain fire and drop lightning on Gorr's barren planet.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg 625w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A young Thor without Mjolnir causing the skies to rain fire and drop lightning on Gorr's barren planet.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg 625w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111120784/5882783-3396413078-Thor%25.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A young Thor without Mjolnir causing the skies to rain fire and drop lightning on Gorr's barren planet.</figcaption></figure><p>Being the God of Thunder, Thor can summon and control the powers of the storm, causing rain, wind, thunder, and lightning even making it rain fire. Thor has shown the ability to create electrical storms, hurricane winds, tornadoes, tidal waves, blizzards as well as earthquakes that have been shown to run across an entire planet. Thor has the ability to affect the weather on a planetary wide scale but often refrains from doing so from the mass damage that it could cause. Thor is able to stop any of the weather conditions that he creates. Thor’s ability to control the weather has been said to exceed those of beings such as <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>. It is a very common misconception that Thor is unable to control the weather without his hammer but he indeed can and has been shown to do so on a number of occasions even before he had ever wielded Mjolnir. Thor has a strong affinity with the forces of the weather being the Thunder God. Mjolnir allows him to better regulate his powers of lightning and controlling the weather compared to without. It allows him to direct his energy attacks more precisely and with seemingly less effort than when he creates lightning without it, Mjolnir can be seen as a shortcut to accessing his powers. Thor has also been able to enhance his punches by engulfing them in lightning. Thor has also been shown to be able to conduct a planetary wide lightning storm to aid him in the process of physically melding back together a crumbling populated moon.</p><h4><strong>Flight</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-247324\" data-ratio=\"0.65\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-247324\"><img alt=\"Mjolnir grants Thor flight.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mjolnir grants Thor flight.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11233/247324-65301-thor.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mjolnir grants Thor flight.</figcaption></figure><p>Thor naturally does not have the innate ability. Only via hurling Mjolnir and grasping onto its thong can Thor fly. In Earth's atmosphere, he limits himself to the speed of sound. When in space, he travels at faster than light speeds. Although, Thor has been able to manipulate the air around him and hover without Mjolnir. He has been seen flying without Mjolnir a couple of times like when he and Hyperion flew extraterrestrial babies off of the planet.</p><h4><strong>Resurrection</strong></h4><p>Thor has displayed the ability to resurrect beings that have been killed though it is unknown how long a period can pass between the death and point in which Thor’s intent to resurrect for the process to be successful. Thor was shown to have the ability to resurrect the Gods of Asgard but failed to resurrect the soul of his fallen comrade Captain America. Though Thor is a god, he does not have the ability to resurrect whomever he wants at any point in time. Only beings such as <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> have shown the ability to resurrect the lives of those who have been long dead and even his powers have limits in this field.</p><h4><strong>Negation of Mystical Energy</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer has shown the ability to negate mystical energy within a certain area. He showed this ability when he was fighting the <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a> in the past and he threw his hammer around the area in which they were fighting which stripped the powerful Juggernaut of his invulnerability as well as his ability to be an immovable object.</p><h4><strong>Soul Transmigration</strong></h4><p>Thor's hammer has the ability to transmigrate souls.</p><h4><strong>Teleportation (Portals)</strong></h4><p>Thor himself can go and send people to different worlds, universes, and even to different/higher dimensions.</p><h4><strong>Reverse Energy</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer can reverse energy polarities and atomic processes.</p><h4><strong>Inter-Dimensional Energy A</strong><strong>bsorption</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer can tap or attract quantities of Interdimensional Matrix energy.</p><h4><strong>Detection</strong></h4><p>Thor's hammer can detect where evil is afoot or can track anyone who doesn't want to be found. In addition, Thor’s hammer can track practically all kinds of energy signature.</p><h4><strong>Healing</strong></h4><p>Thor's hammer can speed up healing.</p><h4><strong>Mind Manipulation</strong></h4><p>Thor's hammer can erase someone's memory and can put them to sleep.</p><h4><strong>Spy</strong></h4><p>Thor could spy on people like a closed-circuit TV. From the same dimension, or another without being noticed.</p><h4><strong>Anti-Force</strong></h4><p>One of Thor's most powerful attacks, Anti-Force can destroy entire armies and hurt high-tier powerful beings.</p><h4><strong>Anti-Gravity</strong></h4><p>A power that can literally physically incapacitates his opponent and sent them where they came from and the ability to control the position of beings, ignoring gravity.</p><h4><strong>Matter Manipulation</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer has given him the ability to affect matter on a wide scale and has been shown to give Thor the ability to transmute elements.</p><h4><strong>Invisibility/Intangibility</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer has been shown to make either himself or others completely invisible or intangible. This ability also has the opposite effect as it has been shown to disrupt the phasing abilities of beings such as <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Shadowcat</a> and <a href=\"/vision/4005-1504/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1504\">Vision</a>. The disruption effects, however, were not permanent and both recovered.</p><h4><strong>Force Field Creation</strong></h4><p>Mjolnir has given Thor the ability to create powerful barriers that have been seen to be impenetrable. This has given Thor the ability to contain powerful explosions.</p><h4><strong>Energy Absorption and Projection</strong></h4><p>Thor has been seen to have the ability to absorb energy blasts from even the most powerful of beings. Thor can store this energy within Mjolnir and direct it back at a given target. In addition, Mjolnir can amplify energy ten-thousandth fold(as he did in his fight with Thanosi, a <a href=\"/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos</a> doppelganger). Thor does not even have to wait for an opponent to shoot a blast of energy, he can absorb it from their body as he did to Kang The Conqueror.</p><h4><b>God Blast</b></h4><p>The God Blast is Thor’s most powerful attack that comes with him being a God, Despite popular opinions, This can be done without his trusty hammer. Thor’s God Blast has been shown to be powerful enough to destroy beings such as the Midgard Serpent as well as causing harm to Galactus himself that caused him to retreat (though Galactus was in a weakened state at the time). Thor does not often use this ability for its destructive force and harm that it could cause to the surrounding area. This power can be used without the hammer, but it is less concentrated as shown in a fight with an enemy, once used a large circle was emitted from his body and destroyed the local area. He once used such an attack against Durok The Demolisher, a being who has defeated him in the past, although he did this without Mjolnir.</p><h4><strong>Thermo-Blast</strong></h4><p>Thermo-Blast is one of Thor's most powerful attacks ever, it's powerful enough to shake the Universe.</p><h4><strong>Mystical Link</strong></h4><p>Thor’s hammer obeys his command and returns to him when he throws it. Mjolnir could pass through an entire planet in order to return to Thor’s grip if he so commanded it. Mjolnir also has shown the ability to transform Thor back into his human identity Donald Blake. When Thor is in his human form Mjolnir is transformed into a wooden stick that he uses to assist him with walking. In the past, the hammer had a limitation on it in which if Thor let go of it for more than 60 seconds he would be transformed back into his human form but this enchantment is no longer apart of continuity.</p><h4><strong>Worthiness Enchantment</strong></h4><p>One of the spells that Odin cast upon the hammer Mjolnir was that it could not be lifted by a being that is not worthy of its great power. There are two great misconceptions that go along with this enchantment that is one: without the hammer Thor has no power and also that Thor's hammer can always be wielded by him. Thor has shown in the past that when he goes astray of the noble path he has lost the right to wield Mjolnir. Mjolnir has been also wielded by noble beings such as <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"/beta-ray-bill/4005-6139/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6139\">Beta Ray Bill</a>. Regarding his powers, Thor retains the use of his weather manipulation. He has been shown to cast Thunder down onto enemy's with just a thought and levitate himself with the air around him. He can also perform a god-blast without the hammer. His strength stays the same regardless and he has been able to fight the hulk Hand to Hand for an entire issue without Mjolnir.</p><h3><strong><ins>Skills</ins></strong></h3><h4><strong>Master Combatant</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612343\" data-ratio=\"1.0327137546468\" data-width=\"1345\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1345px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-612343\"><img alt=\"Weapon-masters: Thor vs. Hercules!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" data-width=\"619\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 1345w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 929w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 619w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weapon-masters: Thor vs. Hercules!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 1345w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 929w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/612343-therc.jpg 619w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" data-width=\"619\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Weapon-masters: Thor vs. Hercules!</figcaption></figure><p>Thor is one of the most trained and experienced warriors in all of the Marvel Universe. Even when Thor had been stripped of his powers and made into a mortal, he was able to defeat a bunch of fodder and also save Captain America with his own shield and wield Mjolnir simultaneously. Thor was also able to fistfight with Hercules but was only shown to be slightly under in terms of skill. Thor often prefers to use brawling-type techniques when fighting beings such as <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a>, Gladiator, and Abomination. Despite being a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, Thor's greatest feats of skill come from his weapon expertise. He is easily one of the greatest and most versatile weapon experts in the Marvel Universe, he is generally seen wielding his hammer but has also shown great prowess using weapons such as an ax, sword, bow and arrow, shields and clubs.</p><h4><strong>Master Tactician</strong></h4><p>Due to the fact that Thor is a War God, he has had a great experience with devising plans of war. He has often assisted beings such as Tony Stark as well as Captain America in devising plans of attack while they themselves are known as some of the greatest tacticians. Thor derives his great knowledge of war from Earth as well as the other nine worlds of Asgard.</p><h2>Former Abilities</h2><h4><strong>Odin-Force</strong></h4><p>Thor at one point had access to an unlimited amount of power that was known as the Odin-Force. The Odin-Force was the power that Odin himself had wielded before his death that was then passed onto Thor. The Odin-Force was comprised of Odin's power as King of Asgard combined with the powers of his brothers Vili and Ve. These powers added to the powers Thor already had made him virtually omnipotent. Obtaining the Odin-Force made Thor one of the most powerful beings in the entire Marvel Universe. When Thor possessed this power he was able to achieve a number of feats that have not been duplicated by any other being in the Marvel Universe. Thor was able to destroy <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">Captain America's shield</a> with a look, teleported Asgard over New York City, recreated the moon after it has been nearly disintegrated, as well as defeat the Sorcerer Supreme <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>.</p><h4><strong>Rune Magic</strong></h4><p>Thor was able to acquire the powers of the Rune during the battle of Ragnarok. These powers granted Thor virtually an unlimited supply of magical powers that were added to the powers he had previously gained from drinking from the Well of Mimir for wisdom. Thor was shown to have mystical abilities that had virtually no match. Some of the abilities that the Rune Magic granted Thor were the ability of flight without the aid of Mjolnir, teleportation, destroying a copied version of Mjolnir as well as summon a wave of mystical energy that could destroy an army of Loki who was armed with Mjolnir. Thor also displayed the ability to rebuild Valhalla as well as decapitate Loki without ending his life. Since the rebirth of Thor, it is unknown whether or not he still is able to wield the magic of the Runes but since he was resurrected, his eyes were restored and he has not shown any of the vast abilities that he once had with the power of the Rune Magic.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>Thor has no specific weaknesses to a substance or magic. Since the events of Thor's hammer being nearly destroyed during his battle with <a href=\"/bor/4005-58894/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58894\">Bor</a>, Thor's life is now tied to his hammer as was <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>'s warning when he repaired it. Thor's powers have fluctuated throughout the years and although at one point he was able to stalemate Zeus in a battle years ago, he himself has stated that he can only go against characters of such power with the Odin-Force. Additionally, when Thor succumbs to the \"Warrior's Madness\" he loses much of his higher cognitive brain function and becomes mentally erratic, unreasonable, unpredictable, savage; acting and reacting in an almost purely instinctual, animalistic and uncontrollable manner.</p><h2>Personal Details</h2><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459212\" data-ratio=\"1.5149006622517\" data-width=\"604\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 604px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-459212\"><img alt=\"Thor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 604w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 604w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24676/459212-thor__1_.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Gender: </strong>Male</li><li><b>Height:</b> (Thor) 6'6\" (Blake) 5'9\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> (Thor) 640 lbs.

He was raised by him and has fought alongside him many times. It was Odin who had Mjolnir crafted for him. Throughout his life Odin has striven to teach Thor how to be a wise and just ruler for the time when he would rule Asgard. Part of Odin's formula for this has been to frequently send Thor to Earth as a mortal, partially as a punsihment for his reckless pride, but also to teach him humility. Another reason Odin would send Thor to Earth is because he knew it was there that Thor could learn things he could never hope to glean on Asgard; things that would impart upon Thor the wisdom to not only someday match but to one day surpass he, himself in wisdom. Wisdom he could use to attain greater insight and greater power than even he had ever possessed. Wisdom, insight and power enough to do what even Odin could never do; overthrow <a href=\"/those-who-sit-above-in-shadow/4060-56155/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56155\">\"Those Who Sit Above in Shadow\"</a> (Asgard's unseen and little known masters) and thereby end the perpetual the cycle of creation and Raganrok.</p><h3><b>Loki</b></h3><p>Loki is the brother of Thor, and adopted son of Odin. He has always been jealous of Thor because of his favored status with Odin, his honor, his great strength and popularity. Throughout his life he has frequently tried to overthrow Odin and Asgard and attack and discredit Thor. However, Thor's complicated feelings/illogical love for his bother always leads him to forgive/pardon him even though he may not ever be able to actually trust him.</p><h3><b>Sif</b></h3><p>Sif is the Goddess of War and the sister of Heimdall. She has, in and through several realities and story arcs, been the primary love interest of Thor. She is even his wife in some. A mighty warrior, Sif is brave, true and noble. She has been chosen by Odin to marry Thor.</p><h3><b>Amora</b></h3><p>Amora the Enchantress has had an ongoing infatuation with Thor and appears to seek his love, whether it be consensual or otherwise. Over the course of many centuries, and at least a few realities, she and Thor have had several romantic interludes, though they are usually short-lived. Amora is an Asgardian goddess and has in several alternate realities been Thor's wife.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1610: Ultimate Thor</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1312801\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1312801\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Thor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Thor\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 900w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 632w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1312801-1279825862.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Thor</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimate Thor is an alternate version of the 616 Thor that lives in the Ultimate Marvel Universe. He is as well based on the same God of Thunder from Norse Mythology. One of the main differences between these two characters however is that Ultimate Thor does not have a human alter ego. This Thor does not have as many powers as his 616 counterpart as well, and he does not seem to be as reliant on his hammer Mjolnir as a major source of his power. One of the greatest differences between these two characters is that this Thor is a reluctant warrior who is at times unstable instead of being a willing eager combatant warrior. Ultimate Thor is known as being a psychiatric nurse named Thorlief Golmen. Tragically, he suffered a nervous breakdown on his 30 birthday however. He later spent 18 months in an institution. Here he claimed to realize who he truly was and his reason for being sent to Earth in the first place. He told the employees there that his true identity was Thor the Thunder God. He said that he was on a mission to save the planet and put a stop to the possible War of all Wars. On numerous occasions Thor spoke out against American military aggression against outside world powers.</p><h4><b>Origins</b></h4><p>When Nick Fury contacted Thor so that he would join the Ultimate he initially refused to work for the same military organization that he was against. But later when the Hulk appeared in Manhattan Thor only agreed to help if the President doubled the foreign aid budget. After the Ultimates encountered the Hulk, the President agreed to Thor’s demand and he arrived just in time to save Captain Americas life from the clutches of <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Bruce Banner</a>. After the battle, Thor and <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a> became good friends as well as Captain America. Thor agreed to be there to assist them whenever they were in danger. Afterwards, Thor was told about a suspected Chaituri based in Microsenia. When he found that the base was in fact abandoned and was about to explode he was saved by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man’</a>s force field. When the Chaituri invasion force appeared in Arizona Thor was able to rake the survivors there with Iron Man for air support against the Chiaturi spacecraft until the United States Air Force for there. Iron Man later asked Thor for his help in disposing of the Chiaturi bomb that had the power to destroy the entire solar system. Thor then used his power to teleport the bomb to the wastelands of Nastrong where its detonation caused a small ripple in the space time continuum.</p><h4><b>Ultimate War </b></h4><p>In the Ultimate War, Thor was a member of the Ultimates and was seen looking for the dead together with Iron Man after the first attack. Magneto later attacks the Ultimates and states that he was surprised to see Thor in their company. He later asks Thor if he thinks that he is able to change them. Thor hurls his hammer Mjolnir at <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> but <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a> uses his power to send the hammer flying back at Thor sending him through a wall. Later on, the Ultimates fight against the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-men</a> and he manages to defeat <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a> before he is taken down by <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>.</p><h4><b>Ultimate Six</b></h4><p>In the Ultimate Six, Thor was seen with the Ultimates while he was taking in Kraven the hunter. He later though refused to follow Captain Americas orders by catching Kraven and bringing him back in. He is later seen helping the citizens of Bosnia reconstruct their country while he was summoned by the following the Six’s breakout. Thor engages the villain Electro in combat and manages to defeat him during a battle in the White House.</p><p>When Nick Fury contacted Thor so that he would join the Ultimate he initially refused to work for the same military organization that he was against.

Thor later goes to Italy in order tostop a violent demonstration against the super-soldier. The head scientist of the program revelas to that THors powers are not natural rather that there are technological in nature and they come from his hammer and his belt. Gunnar tells him that Thor is truly his mentally troubled brother who stole both of those items and has simply been acting like Thor the God of Thunder. Gunnar told Thor that the equipment gives him super strength and powers that were beyond the comprehension of mortals and that he is far too dangerous to take on alone.</p><p>Thor is later tracked to <a href=\"/norway/4020-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55828\">Norway</a> and after he fails to convince the Ultimates that Gunnar is truly Loki in disguise and changing reality he later enters battle with them. Even though at the beginning Thor was managing to hold his own he is eventually taken down and calls up a storm. At the very last instant Quicksilver arrived and is able to remove his belt taking away Thor’s power and his ability to use Mjolnir properly.

Thor remains in this prison until the last issue of the series as his warnings to the Ultimates are constantly ignored.

In the beginning Loki has the was winning by using his power to change reality in order to become immune to Thor’s hammer and was overpowering him while summoning an army of Asgardians monsters to attack the Ultimates. Afterwards, Loki’s power stop working for no apparent reason During the battle Loki admits that he was the one who was responsible for creating the Norewgian super-soldier program and framing <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>.

So he is an alien relative to humans. The celestials made this to see if the creations could reenact old myths, Thor the son of Odin was chosen to spend the ages reenacting the old Asgard Legends. People on earth however saw Thor as a true god. But once people on earth stopped thinking Asgard was real and went onto other religions, Asgard was in danger. This is the reason Odin banished Thor to earth as Donald Blake; this was done to make humanity believe in Asgard by Thor interacting with the human population. Loki convinced Odin to turn Thor into a woman to further understand humanity; this was to learn how it was like being part of the “inferior” sex. Thor did not change his attitude however and stayed a worthy hero.</p><p>In this reality , Thor joined the avengers, but unlike the 616 avengers these avengers are called the “Iron Avengers” These are a group of robots that are created by Tony Stark based on dead avengers to defend new York. Thor would now spend a lot of time aiding his fellow avengers. He helped foil a plot by Loki to take over New York with Frost giants.</p><p>Thor once against teamed up with somebody who he has done in the 616 universe, this time it was Bruce banner. This was to assist Banner in visiting Clea, the sorceress supreme. To talk about dreams Bruce had been having. Neither Thor nor Bruce was aware that Clea was under the influence of Wong and was in league with Loki. They sent Hulk into the Realm of the Dead to find out about his dreams. Hulk was trapped but Thor saved him and Loki fled.</p><p>Loki somehow found out that they are all creations of the celestials and attempted to get Odin and the rest of the Asgardians to attempt to attack the celestial host. They thought Loki was lying and banished him to Hel. Events transpired and it was revealed that Loki was telling the truth, He agreed with Loki as it was found out that Odin was manipulating them for centuries as he already knew about the celestials. They fought Odin to overthrow him. This is when Thor reverted himself back to a male.</p><p>They fought many Asgardians; Thor was forced to kill the warriors Three. Clea in this time was banished to Hel way back when she was being influenced by Wong, Odin freed her and Thor took her place. Thor escaped with the help of Loki. They returned to Earth and began planning what to do. It was decided, Thor would become the Midgard Serpent and Loki would take the Form of Thor.</p><p>They battled their friends and loved ones , Odin was forced to create a new world in which Thor + Loki defeated Odin. Thor destroyed the Realm tree in this world. Everybody learnt about the Celestial creation because of this, the secrets in the tree were not secrets anymore. Thor and Loki after decided to go back to earth, Loki become a Superhero and took the identify of Thor and joined the avengers. Thor become Donald Blake and lived the rest of his life as a doctor.</p><h3>Earth-2149</h3><p><a href=\"../../marvel-zombies/39-40611/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Marvel Zombies</b></a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699876\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5102880658436\" data-width=\"243\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 243px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699876\"><img alt=\"Zombieverse Thor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" data-width=\"243\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg 243w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zombieverse Thor\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31666/699876-thor_2.jpg 243w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" data-width=\"243\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zombieverse Thor</figcaption></figure><p>Thor in the zombieverse like most other heroes has been transformed into a zombie.

Thor, enraged by this, bombards the Herald with blows from Mjolnir, leaving her dead. <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> sees this and is impressed offering Thor the status of his Herald; Thor accepts as he sees the wearied Asgardian army. Thor is now in service of Galactus only allowing Galactus to consume the energy of \"Un-Developed\" planets. Thor returns to Asgard as one of his father's servants in the form of a crow and tells him the fate of Asgard. A defiant Thor returns to see <a href=\"/asgard/4060-56316/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56316\">Asgard</a> destroyed. <a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a> sits on a boulder as Thor returns. After telling Thor he gave Odin a proper burial, Thor is struck by a Frost Giant straight into his fathers resting place holding his uru mallet. Grasping it he is empowered with the power of Thor. Thor is now in possession of both the power cosmic and the might of Thor, and he trembles at his own power. Loki, seeing Galactus over the horizon, asks for Thor's' help to defend <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>. Thor is elsewhere releasing the warriors of <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> imprisoned underground. Thor instructs <a href=\"../../balder/29-7201/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balder</a> to evacuate the residents of Asgard across the rainbow bridge unto Midgard ( Earth). Loki pleads for Thor to defend Asgard and once again Thor denies him, ashamed of <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a>. Thor would rather it destroyed than let it continue to exist in its current state. He allows Galactus to drain the energy of Asgard. As Balder and the rest watch as Thor takes his rightful place at <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>'s side as Herald.</p><h3>Earth-9811</h3><p>In this reality Thor and the Enchantress have a son, named Balder Blake. He has had many attempts at lifting His father’s hammer but to no avail, On his eighteenth birthday, Blake made his third annual attempt to lift his father's hammer from its memorial, which was placed to mark the end of the Secret wars. He failed to lift the hammer for a third time despite this his friends were still supportive of his efforts.</p><p>Blake and his friends were in the middle of fighting his half brother Malefactor, He had attempted to conquer the earth and this was another attempt, they found out that Crusader, Blake’s friend was a worthy wielder of Mjolnir. She was very reluctant to ever lift as her best friend Blake was not worthy and did not want to make him feel bad. She was forced to do so as events progressed.</p><p>Blake had a variety of powers -</p><p>He can perform some magic and sorcery, This was probably inherited from his mother, the Enchantress, though was not as skilled as her, or his half-brother Vincent. He seems to have some level of super-human strength like most Asgardians and his father, but it was never stated how strong he was.</p><h3>Earth-311: '1602'</h3><p>Thor's mortal form was an Old man, His name was Donal, He was from the order of the Templars. He was placed with the responsibility to transport an artifact to Jerusalem. The artifact was hidden in a cart pulled by donkeys with chairs, pots and broken furniture not to raise suspicion. He had to bring the item to Stephen strange.</p><p>On the way to his location he got captured by a man named Mathew Murdock ( Otto Von Doom's man ) , He wanted the item. Donal escaped and went back to receive his stick, this was the actual artifact. Doom's guards saw Donal and went to attack, Donal slammed his stick on the ground and lighting shot up scaring the guards He turns into Thor and the guards run away as he reveals he is the Thunderer. This staff had been brought to Jeruslam from the north lands over 200 years ago. A man named Hugh de Payns found it beneath a temple. He saw it as a secret that revealed that the gods had walked the earth.</p><p>Donal said he enjoyed being Thor and thought it had came to him as he was worthy, Donal was supposed to fix a rip in time but did not want to do it. He was afraid if he turned into Thor again Thor would not let him turn back for abusing the power. Thor fixes the Rip in time. Thor returns to Asgard and Donal talks to Asgard, as the Issue ends it is apparent he is angry for a reason not stated. Probably he is not allowed to become Thor again.</p><h3>Earth-2301: Mangaverse</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2030588\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2879746835443\" data-width=\"316\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 316px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2030588\"><img alt=\"Thor of the Mangaverse. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-width=\"316\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg 316w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor of the Mangaverse. \" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2030588-thor_odinson__earth_2301_.jpg 316w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 316px) 100vw, 316px\" data-width=\"316\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor of the Mangaverse. </figcaption></figure><p>The Thor in this reality aids the other heroes in their battle against <a href=\"/dormammu/4005-2205/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2205\">Dormammu</a>.

Zemo holds up his skeleton, and the skull is wearing a helmet reminiscent of Thor's original helmet in the 616 continuity</p><h3>Amalgam Comics</h3><p>In the Amalgram Universe, Thor joins with Orion to form Thorion was the son of Thanoseid, but was traded to All-Highfather Odin in order to seal a truce between the realms of Apokolips and New Asgard.</p><p>On an adventure , L'ok D'saad (This is Loki and Desaad), he for whom Thorion was traded, sought to use the Mother Cube and its Infinity Essence to awaken the Sleeping One called Surtur and bring about a second Ragnarok that would end everything. Thorion, however, invoked the power of the Source via his hammer to halt L'ok's evil wishes. Because of the great energies released during their conflict, Thorion was turned into a cosmic being , a celestial.</p><p>In Unlimited Access, a limited series which further explored themes introduced in DC vs. Marvel, the hero known as Access formed an amalgamation of what appeared to be the Silver Age versions of Thor and Superman. Together, they become known as Thor-El.</p><h3>What if...?</h3><p>In one of the first What if...? story-lines, Jane Foster discovered the stick rather than Donald Blake, spending time as a female Thor (called Thordis) before she was recalled to Asgard, allowing Odin to return the hammer to its rightful owner, although Jane went on to be elevated to godhood so that she could marry Odin.</p><p>In What If...Rogue possessed the power of Thor? - Rogue accidentally permanently absorbed Thor when she and Mystique attempted to break the Brotherhood out of prison, resulting in her killing most of the Avengers and the Brotherhood when she was unable to cope with Thor's power. Although Loki attempted to manipulate her into waging war on Asgard after she was able to lift Thor's hammer, the sight of Odin's genuine sense of loss allowed Thor's remnants to manifest in her subconscious, affirming that he was an ideal as well as a person, allowing Rogue to inherit his power and position as she became the new Thor.</p><h3>Dargo Ktor</h3><p>Dargo Ktor is the host of a 26th-century version of Thor, who is empowered when holding Mjolnir, a subject of worship in that century. </p><h2><b>Other Media</b></h2><h3><b>Television </b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027202\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027202\"><img alt=\"Animated version of Thor from the 1960s cartoon.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Animated version of Thor from the 1960s cartoon.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/5/54353/2027202-thor___animated_version_face_color_lrg.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Animated version of Thor from the 1960s cartoon.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Thor first appeared on TV in 1966 on <a href=\"/the-marvel-super-heroes/4075-322/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-322\"><em>The Marvel Super Heroes</em> </a>segment \"The Mighty Thor.\" He was voiced by Chris Wiggins.</li></ul><ul><li>Thor's secret identity Donald Blake appeared in the 1980s<em><a href=\"/spider-man/4075-514/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-514\"> Spider-Man</a></em> cartoon in the episode \" Wrath of the <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sub-Mariner</a>,\" voiced by Jack Angel.</li></ul><ul><li>Thor appeared in the<em> <a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</a></em> episode \"Vengeance of Loki.\"</li></ul><ul><li>Thor appeared in television movie (based off of the show of the same name) titled <em><a href=\"../../the-incredible-hulk-returns/223-331/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Incredible Hulk Returns</a></em>, played by actor Eric Allan Kramer.</li></ul><ul><li>Thor makes a cameo appearance in the <a href=\"/xmen-the-animated-series/4075-26/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-26\"><em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em></a> episode \" <a href=\"../../dark-phoenix-saga/39-42183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Phoenix Saga</a> (Part 3): <a href=\"../../dark-phoenix/29-9731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Phoenix</a>,\" as a mental image of the Phoenix.</li></ul><ul><li>Thor appeared twice in <a href=\"/fantastic-four-the-animated-series/4075-237/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-237\"><em>Fantastic Fou</em>r</a> animated series, in the episodes \" To Battle the Living Planet \" and \" When Comes Galactus,\" where he teams up with the Fantastic Four and <a href=\"../../ghost-rider/29-4268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost Rider</a> to combat <a href=\"../../worldmind/29-51594/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ego the Living Planet</a> and Galactus.

Early on in the film, Thor discovers that Loki trapped Odin on Earth after stealing his identity, and tries to find him. The two brothers find Odin in Norway, where he tells them that he is dying. Before passing away, Odin warns his sons of Hela, their long lost older sister, who will be free from her prison once he dies. True to Odin's word, Hela soon appears, and attacks Thor and Loki. In the ensuing battle, Hela destroys Mjolnir, forcing the two brothers to flee. Hela attacks them while they are being transported through the Bifrost, which results in both of them becoming stranded on the alien planet of<a href=\"/sakaar/4020-41069/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41069\"> Sakaar</a>.</p><p>While on Sakaar, Thor is captured by a former Asgardian warrior known as Valkyrie, and is forced to fight in the <a href=\"/grandmaster/4005-32735/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32735\">Grandmaster</a>'s gladiatorial games. It is in his first fight that Thor encounters his old teammate the Hulk, who ended up on Sakaar after the events of <em>Age of Ultron</em>. Eventually, Thor hatches a plot to escape, and recruits the Hulk, Loki and Valkyrie to accompany him. The four head to Asgard, where they engage in a final battle with Hela. Realizing that Hela is invincible due to her power coming from Asgard itself, Thor decides that the only way to beat her is to destroy the kingdom itself. Loki unleashes Surtur, who destroys Asgard and seemingly vanquishes Hela. The film ends with Thor, his allies and the surviving Asgardians heading off into space to find a new home, with Thor acting as their new king.</p><p>The film sees the return of most of the cast from the first two movies, along with <a href=\"/mark-ruffalo/4040-68289/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68289\">Mark Ruffalo </a>as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cate-blanchett/4040-68741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68741\">Cate Blanchett</a> as Hela, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tessa-thompson/4040-90704/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-90704\">Tessa Thompson</a> as Valkyrie, <a href=\"/jeff-goldblum/4040-69429/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69429\">Jeff Goldblum</a> as the Grandmaster, and <a href=\"/karl-urban/4040-70441/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-70441\">Karl Urban</a> as Skurge.</p><h4><a href=\"/avengers-infinity-war/4025-2297/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-2297\">Avengers: Infinity War</a> (2018)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6933906\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6933906\"><img alt=\"Thor with his axe\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg 500w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thor with his axe\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg 500w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6933906-thor%20in%20wakanda.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Thor with his axe</figcaption></figure><p>Hemsworth once again returns in the third <em>Avengers</em> film.

Shortly after Thanos' victory, the remaining Avengers team up with Captain Marvel to track down the Mad Titan and destroy him, believing they can use the Infinity Stones to resurrect his victims. The Avengers quickly overpower Thanos, but are crestfallen to discover that he has already destroyed the Infinity Stones so that nobody else can use them.

They find a drunken and disheveled Thor who is a mere shadow of his former self, his depression and guilt over failing to stop Thanos having overwhelmed him. Thor initially turns them down, but is persuaded to help by the Hulk. Using the time travel device the team has constructed, Thor and Rocket are sent to Asgard back during the events of <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>, where they are tasked with stealing the Reality Stone from Jane Foster's body. While there, Thor encounters Frigga, and has a heart to heart conversation with her shortly before her impending death. Bolstered by his mother's encouragement, Thor regains his heroic resolve.</p><p>Thor and Rocket return to the present with both the Reality Stone and the 2013 version of Mjolnir (which Thor finds he is still worthy of wielding despite his fall into depression). When a time-traveling version of Thanos from 2014 attacks Avengers HQ to get the Infinity Stones, Thor wields both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker to fight against him. After Thanos is destroyed and his victims are restored to life, Thor chooses to leave Earth to travel the universe with the Guardians.</p><p> </p><h3>Merchandise</h3><p>Thor has long been a popular character for merchandise. Companies like Bowen, Toy Biz, Hasbro, Mego, Diamond Collectibles, Lego, Max Factory, Bandai, Sideshow Collectibles, and many others have produced toys and statues of the character.

In his youth, Tony Stark was a precociously intelligent young boy. When Tony was 7 he was sent to a boarding school, and during this experience he found people difficult to relate to. This was when he became fascinated by machines. By the age of 15 Tony had enrolled in MIT (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in <a href=\"../../boston-massachusetts/34-56311/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. He graduated at the top of his class at age 19 with double masters in physics and engineering.</p><p>At the age of 21, his parents were tragically killed in a car accident. Afterwards, Tony inherited <a href=\"../../stark-industries/34-56006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stark Industries</a>, an unparalleled mega-conglomerate that mostly manufactured weapons for the United States military. One of his first projects as the new CEO was to purchase the manufacturer who designed his parents' car and have the faulty brake system, which was seemingly the cause of their deaths, redesigned in order to prevent any further incidents, thus saving lives. Unknown to Stark, the true architect of his parents' deaths was a business move by Republic Oil (later renamed <a href=\"../../roxxon/65-56010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxxon Oil</a>). Lacking in business skills, Tony promoted secretary <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pepper Potts</a> to be his executive assistant and left the majority of his workload on her so that he could avoid what he saw as a burden.</p><p>During the war in <a href=\"../../afghanistan/34-55914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Afghanistan</a>, Stark was at one of his munitions plants testing new technology for the military when he was injured by his own land mine that lodged shrapnel near his heart. Tony was then captured by a local warlord named <a href=\"../../wong-chu/29-66473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wong-Chu</a> (a lackey of the <a href=\"../../the-mandarin/29-3530/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mandarin</a>) and forced under threat of death to create a doomsday weapon for him with another captive, the famed Nobel award-winning physicist, <a href=\"../../yinsen/29-7858/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yin Sen</a>. The shrapnel was going to enter his heart and kill him, but he and the physicist created an arc reactor which kept the shrapnel away from his heart. In response, Tony built <a href=\"/iron-man-armor/4055-50749/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50749\">a suit of armor</a> to help himself escape captivity. In the suit, Stark took on the warlord and his men and avenged Yin Sen's death, thus Iron Man was born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tony Stark made his first appearance in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/tales-of-suspense-39-iron-man-is-born/4000-6428/\">Tales of Suspense #39</a> in 1963. He was created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a>, <a href=\"../../larry-lieber/26-4068/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larry Lieber</a>, <a href=\"../../don-heck/26-6609/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don Heck</a>, and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>. Tony's character was loosely based on the life of the rich and successful playboy Howard Hughes. It may be argued that Iron Man symbolized the meritocracy of capitalism. In the 1960's when Iron Man was created, the threat of Communism from the USSR was huge. Not only did Iron Man fight communists and people from the Eastern Block, but he sent the message that great things could be achieved through thrift, risk and hard work, as opposed to Spider-Man's origin story a year previous whereby Peter Parker gained powers from being bitten by a spider.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>When Marvel re-emerged on the comic book scene in the Silver Age (some say Marvel's re-emergence signaled the beginning of the Silver Age of Comics) a big factor in their popularity was making easily relatable characters. In many cases, this took the form of a teenage hero for whom others felt some empathy (as at the time readership was primarily for those of a younger age.) Such heroes included the X-Men and Spider-Man. When it came to portraying more mature characters, there was still an emphasis on portraying the character's humanity as much as their heroics. In the case of Tony Stark, this took on essentially two different aspects. He had to battle alcoholism and re-organize his company so as not to be a war profiteer any longer. Over the course of his publication history, he has had to deal with both aspects of his life.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>James Rhodes</h3><p>After fleeing from enemy territory Tony met and befriended the pilot <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Rhodes</a> who had been shot down in his helicopter. By working together, they were able to make their escape and upon arriving back in the United States, Tony decided to continue being Iron Man in order to fight injustice. He believed that he had a limited amount of time left to live due to his injury, and therefore wanted to make the most of it. Therefore, he began making vast improvements to the technology of his power armor.</p><h3>Secret Identity</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2786640\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1473384030418\" data-width=\"1052\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1052px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2786640\"><img alt=\"Original armor painted gold.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 1052w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 480w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Original armor painted gold.</figcaption></figure><p>When Tony finally admitted his double identity to his fiancee Joanna Nivena, she encouraged him to use the armor to become a super hero and save lives. Iron Man began to establish himself as one of the U.S.'s most eminent super heroes, but while halting a breakout of lions and tigers from a circus, Tony saw how his armor frightened the people he was defending. Asking his date Marion what she would do if she were Iron Man, Tony painted his armor in stainless gold. Tony Stark allowed the public at large to believe that he was no more than a rich playboy while his identity as Iron Man would remain a secret. Since Iron Man was often seen at Stark Industries, Tony circulated the idea that Iron Man was his personal bodyguard. Stark, of course, still had his heart condition which meant that any day could potentially be his last. Luckily for him, his heart condition became publicly known and he was eventually healed by way of an artificial heart transplant.</p><p>When testing his \"Stark Special\" race car, Tony wound up in a wreck, but was saved at the last minute by ex-boxer Harry <a href=\"../../happy-hogan/29-4262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Happy\" Hogan</a> . To repay Happy, Tony hired him as a chauffeur, although Happy became more like a bodyguard, resenting Iron Man. At the same time, former Stark Industries scientist Gregor Shapanka menaced Tony as <a href=\"../../jack-frost/29-35727/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Frost</a> (later renamed Blizzard), a villain who could generate ice. Happy would often try to play for Pepper's affection, but she was more interested in Tony. However, as Tony's heart could fail at any time, he didn't want to commit himself to a serious relationship since he could die unexpectedly. Happy remained extremely faithful to Tony, telling Iron Man straight out that if he had harmed Tony he would regret it during a period in which Iron Man was thought to have killed Tony. Happy even almost died when delivering a device to Iron Man that would stop <a href=\"../../titanium-man/29-13823/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titanium Man</a>.</p><h3>Formation of the Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181917\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4325\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181917\"><img alt=\"Iron Man along with the Avengers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man along with the Avengers.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man along with the Avengers.</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki</a> framed the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> for wrecking a train in the hope that <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thor</a> would battle him, the Hulk's friend <a href=\"../../rick-jones/29-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Jones</a> sent a message to the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> asking for their help.

Shortly afterwards, after a fight with the <a href=\"../../space-phantom/29-7243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Space Phantom</a>, the Hulk decided to quit since he thought no one trusted him. Whilst in pursuit of the Hulk and <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> (whom he had teamed up with), the Avengers came upon the body of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, a legendary World War II fighter. The Avengers accepted him into their ranks, and he became close friends with Iron Man. Iron Man even gave Captain America transistors to control the flight of his shield, although Captain America later discarded them since they upset the balance of the shield. After a fight with the original <a href=\"../../masters-of-evil/65-7582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Evil</a> which ended with <a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a> being killed, Iron Man, <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giant-Man</a>, Wasp and Thor all decided to take their leave since they needed a break.

In order to defeat Mr. Doll, Tony completely redesigned his armor into light fitting armor rather than his previously heavy and bulky Armor. With this new armor, he was able to defeat Mr. Doll in a rematch.</p><p>Iron Man initially fought primarily against enemies that were a threat to him or his company, such as <a href=\"../../the-mandarin/29-3530/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mandarin</a>, The Melter, The <a href=\"../../ghost/29-17638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost</a>, and <a href=\"../../spymaster/29-10222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spymaster</a>. He also fought against communist enemies (the 1960's, when Iron Man first debuted, was a time of unparalleled anti-communism) such as The <a href=\"../../crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crimson Dynamo</a>, (the first of who would defect to the U.S.A. and later gave up his life to stop the second Crimson Dynamo) <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a> (who would later defect to the US), The <a href=\"../../titanium-man/29-13823/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titanium Man</a>, and others.

Tony would also eventually be led to an alcohol addiction when he discovered that <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a>, who he had previously supported, was seeking to buy controlling stocks in his company, thus ensuring his continued weapons development for them.</p><p>Later, Tony would become bankrupt and homeless when he lost his company to his rival, <a href=\"../../obadiah-stane/29-31197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Obadiah Stane</a>, who had been manipulating him for some time. During this event, his friend James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes even took on the mantle of Iron Man. Stark would begin rebuilding his fortune when he created a company named Circuits Maximus, which specialized in computer technology. While this was happening, Rhodes was slowly going mad while using the Iron Man armor since its unique interface was designed for Stark's nervous system, and not his own. He eventually succumbs and goes on a rampage. This caused Tony to use a prototype armor that was not yet finished in order to stop Rhodey from causing any more destruction.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4512531\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.86839481555334\" data-width=\"1003\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1003px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4512531\"><img alt=\"Tony Seeks Help.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 1003w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony Seeks Help.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 1003w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony Seeks Help.</figcaption></figure><p>Following this incident, Rhodes repeatedly tried to convince Tony to resume the Iron Man mantle but he kept refusing. Now somewhat fearful of his past alcoholism and how Stane had taken advantage of it, Tony felt that he had grown dependent upon the armour, whilst he had \"rotted\" on the inside. As a result, Tony didn't feel worthy of the high-tech armour which Rhodes used and relied on a suit of armour which visually looked almost exactly the same as his original, grey armour (but which was much more sophisticated). As Tony continued fighting crime in this suit, Stane realized that Tony wasn't as beaten as he had assumed, and repeatedly tried various tactics to destroy Tony and make him sink into alcoholism once more. This all culminated in Stane kidnapping many of Tony's allies and friends, and bombing Circuits Maximus. As a result of this bombing, Rhodes was injured too badly to use his suit of armour, and Tony's friend <a href=\"/morley-erwin/4005-31951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31951\">Morley Erwin</a> was killed.

As for Stark’s company, it was sold to a Japanese rival named Fujikawa Industries.</p><h3>Onslaught &amp; Heroes Reborn</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916059\" data-ratio=\"1.5422077922078\" data-width=\"308\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 308px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916059\"><img alt=\"Iron Man Reborn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-width=\"308\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg 308w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man Reborn\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg 308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-width=\"308\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man Reborn</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for the teenage Tony, <a href=\"../../onslaught/29-13352/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught</a> arrived soon after and it prevented him from gaining greater control over his life.

Also, Tony was brought back to his normal adult age but still retained the teenage Tony’s memories. Tony also gained the help of <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> and his law firm associate, <a href=\"/foggy-nelson/4005-3124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3124\">Foggy Nelson</a>. They helped him regain ownership of his company and assets. Next, Tony reconciled with the Avengers and rejoined the team.</p><p>While trying to save an android by downloading its program into his power suit, the Iron Man armor was influenced by <a href=\"../../ultron/29-2242/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultron</a> who had embedded himself in the androids systems without the android knowing. Ultron used the armor to cause Tony to go into a cardiac arrest after a shock from villain <a href=\"../../whiplash/29-12709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whiplash</a>. That shock awoke the suit and gave it a mind of its own. It knew that Tony was in cardiac arrest and saved him. Tony welcomed the live armor until it committed murder, and until it began wanting to merge itself with Tony, making him a human machine. Tony decided to battle the armor that had gained a mind of its own. During the battle however, Tony suffered another heart attack. The armor, which still cared about its creator, decided to save him and gave Tony its own cybernetic heart, replacing his own. This worked effectively but meant that Tony had to constantly recharge the battery power in order to keep his new heart functioning. After this incident, Tony decided to return to his original armor.</p><p>Tony would fall in love with a woman named <a href=\"../../rumiko-fujikawa/29-4264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rumiko Fujikawa</a>, the daughter of the man who had previously taken over his company. She only began dating him to rebel against her father however, and did not truly share his feelings for her. Due to the lack of any real intimacy between the two, their relationship soon became tumultuous, with Rumiko even cheating on Tony with one of his business rivals because she thought he had become boring. Strangely, Rumiko was murdered by an Iron Man impostor.</p><h3>Public Identity Revealed and Secretary of Defense</h3><p>Stark would later reveal his identity to the world when saving a puppy from a speeding car since he was unable to completely mask himself in time. Afterwards, Tony discovered that the Government was once again using his technology, and was able to do so legally due to a copyright loophole that Tony exposed himself to by revealing his secret identity. Tony decided to accept a Presidential appointment to serve as the President's new Secretary of Defense so that he could monitor and direct the use of his technology by the Government.</p><h3>Avengers Disassembled &amp; Extremis</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181179\" data-ratio=\"1.505\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181179\"><img alt=\"Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.</figcaption></figure><p>During <a href=\"../../avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Disassembled</a>, in which the <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a> goes insane and kills several of her teammates on the Avengers, Wanda made Tony Stark confront the Ambassador of <a href=\"../../latveria/34-41031/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latveria</a> while drunk at the <a href=\"../../united-nations-headquarters/34-56629/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations</a>.

The other members of this still functioning group consist of <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"../../black-bolt/29-4329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Bolt</a>, and <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a>. Their first meeting was in <a href=\"../../wakanda/34-41027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakanda</a> where the group also offered membership to the <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>, whom politely rejected it. However, although the rest of the members had different views and did not believe that an alliance like this would be of much use, they still agree to work together and at least share information. In one case, shortly before the events of <a href=\"../../civil-war/39-40615/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War</a>, the Illuminati decided to launch the Hulk into outer space feeling. He soon found out that the government was making decisions on the <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Human Registration Act</a>. At first, Stark is very much against the idea, even going so far as to hire the Titanium Man to attack him in order to manipulate public opinion in his favor. Tony also tries to talk the government out of Registration but his appeal is ignored after the tragedy at <a href=\"../../stamford-ct/34-45571/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stamford</a>, <a href=\"../../connecticut/34-56118/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connecticut</a>, in which members of the <a href=\"../../new-warriors/65-11896/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Warriors</a> confronted a villain named <a href=\"/nitro/4005-3160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3160\">Nitro</a> in a residential neighborhood, setting off an explosion that killed many innocent lives. When the heroes unite in the face of this tragedy in Stamford , they move around some of the rubble to find if there are any survivors. Meanwhile, Tony tells <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> who has caught Nitro’s scent to go after him. The trail leaves cold next to the water, but Iron Man lets Wolverine borrow one of his suits to traverse underwater.</p><p>After the Stamford incident and another in which Tony's armors are hacked and used to attack innocent people, Stark reconsiders his position and the morality of super human registration. He reversed his decision and publicly spearheading the support for the Super-human Registration Act. Support among the super hero community is mixed however, and the conflict leads to the Civil War in the Marvel Universe.</p><p>Stark was able to convince many heroes including <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> to join the pro-registration side and ban the law. Tony also convinced Spider-Man to show the whole world his identity. They begin to hunt down heroes who on the anti-registration side who have gone rogue, led by <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>. Tony also worked with Mr. Fantastic to build a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Negative Zone</a> to hold rogue superhumans, but many heroes begin to question the methods of Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic when a <a href=\"/ragnarok/4005-47573/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47573\">Thor clone</a> they created kills Bill Foster, the second <a href=\"../../goliath/29-3470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goliath</a>, a friend on the anti-registration side, the combined trauma of witnessing Foster's death, the firsthand view of the Prison 42 and a heated fight with Captain America causes Spider-Man to see the error of his ways. He publicly admits his mistake and joins Captain America's anti-reg forces much to Iron Man's anger. Further questions about their motives arise when it is discovered that they are using former villains to hunt down anti-registration forces. When the anti-registration heroes decide to attack the Negative Zone, it triggers the final battle of the Civil War. While Iron Man is facing off against Captain America his armor is shut down by the <a href=\"../../vision/29-1504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vision</a>. Captain America begins savagely beating Iron Man until he realizes the damage that the war has caused. Captain America then decides to surrender in order to prevent any more bloodshed but still refuses to register. Afterwards, Maria concedes her position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>While Captain America was being brought into SHIELD custody he was shot by <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones</a>, later revealed to be working for the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>. Many of the anti-registration heroes even go so far as to presume Iron Man to be involved with regards to Steve’s death. While Iron Man was grieving over Steve’s dead body in a SHIELD facility, Wolverine breaks in and tells Stark that if I ever found him to be involved in any way to Steve’s death, he will personally kill him.</p><p>Later, Iron Man decides that there must always be a Captain America and that the dream must live on.

The Illuminati lured the Hulk into a space-faring vessel and launched him into outer space in order to send him to a world where his power would not be a threat to the sanctity of innocent lives. The <a href=\"../../world-war-hulk/39-42294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World War Hulk</a> story occurs upon his return as the Hulk seeks revenge on Iron Man and the other Illuminati members.</p><p>Tony Stark is the first hero to confront the Hulk upon his return, hoping to prevent any further loss of life on Earth. Donning a modified \"<a href=\"/iron-man-hulkbuster-armor-mk-i/4055-57781/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57781\">Hulkbuster</a>\" armor, Iron Man engages the Hulk in combat in Manhattan (whose population was previously evacuated to safety by S.H.I.E.L.D. upon Stark's orders). Iron Man makes an attempt to use specially designed nanobots to deactivate the Hulk's powers, but this proves unsuccessful due to the nanobots being sabotaged beforehand by a member of the Initiative. His new Hulkbuster armor and <a href=\"../../stark-tower/34-40830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stark Tower</a> are destroyed in the battle that ensues. While being held captive in Madison Square Garden arena, Tony Stark manages to contact <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> via his extremis enhanced powers and informs Dugan of a last resort plan to prevent the Hulk from attacking the rest of the world. The plan is to send the entirety of Manhattan into the Negative Zone. The plan would have the affect of killing himself, the Hulk, the <a href=\"../../warbound/65-43240/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warbound</a>, and all heroes and agents on the island.

Concerned that all the members of AGM lacked passion, and zealotry, he was certain that they were not the ones behind the massacre. The prediction proved accurate once again, when, during an honorary ceremony in , another set of repulsor technology infused suicide terrorists, this time disguised as monks, caused mass destruction, and killed all the members of the country’s heroic squad.</p><p>Once there to investigate, Iron Man, War Machine and Pepper confirmed Tony’s suspicions, with more clues that the technology was repulsor based, but also improving and growing at a significant rate. The man behind it all was none other than <a href=\"../../ezekiel-stane/29-54531/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ezekiel “Zeke” Stane</a>, the teenage son of Tony’s old adversary, Obadiah Stane (a.k.a. the <a href=\"../../obadiah-stane/29-31197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Monger</a>). Who, with the use of cheap Stark based technology equipment he acquired from black market exchanges, was methodically trying to destroy Tony’s operations from the root, and most importantly, end his Tony’s life.</p><p>Putting the investigation for the culprit of the two suicide bombings aside for a while, Tony and Pepper attended a charity gala at Tony’s penthouse in. After a small argument, Pepper stepped outside the building, with Tony coming after her. He was then stopped by Zeke Stane himself, who had managed to sneak in the building. Distracting Tony for a while, he achieved his true goal: another set of suicide bombers entered the building, and everyone inside was caught up in a huge explosion.</p><h3>Pepper Potts At The End Of The World</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/4050-21487/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21487\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073343\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.48275862068966\" data-width=\"609\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 609px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073343\"><img alt=\"Man on Fire\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 609w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Man on Fire\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 609w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Man on Fire</figcaption></figure><p>Managing to activate the Extremis under sheath, and call his armor from the other room in virtually no time, Tony not only managed to escape, but also see the figure of Zeke Stane, sarcastically smirking at him, at the exact point of the detonation. Searching for Pepper, he located her through her Stark ID badge, buried under the debris. As he watched the ambulance carrying Pepper away from the scene, Tony was stunned to see another survivor: Zeke Stane himself. Tony was certain that Stane was the man behind the attacks, but had no substantial proof of it. Stane on the other hand, escaped the medical facility he was kept in after causing significant mayhem. It was revealed that Stane had undergone a procedure enabling him to store far greater amounts of energy to his body, and channeling the energy as a weapon through his hands, but the intense amounts of heat, caused his skin to burn out. As a solution, Zeke decided it was time to create a uniform in order to absorb and redirect the energy from his body.</p><p>In the meantime, Tony was informed that Pepper’s condition was critical – a shrapnel penetrated her chest cavity, and was closing into her heart. Adding the other injuries she sustained during the explosion, made an operation about the removal of the shrapnel, impossible. Determined to save Pepper, Tony awaited for her to regain consciousness in order to explain the situation, and offer her a solution: adding a derivation of the repulsor that kept him alive after his own accident years go, to her chest, to prevent the shrapnel from reaching her heart, while she was recuperating. Later on, Tony went to , where another explosion took place. At that time, and while giving Maria Hill insight about his past with Zeke’s father, Obadiah, Tony started to suspect that Zeke had been using parts from his own original technology to achieve what he had done. Scanning the site for Starktech, he found one more damaged repulsor, what came to be Zeke’s trademark, until that point. Tony’s search came to an abrupt end after he was attacked by remote controlled androids, commanded by Chinese agents, while accused of unauthorized access. Defeating them without much trouble, Tony headed back to Pepper’s side, where the doctor informed him that all went well. Little did Tony know that Zeke Stane had managed to complete his suit by that point, and was setting up the final pieces in order to retract his revenge against him.</p><h3>Irrational Actors</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/4050-21487/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21487\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073351\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.9846547314578\" data-width=\"391\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 391px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073351\"><img alt=\"A Painful Price\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" data-width=\"391\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg 391w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Painful Price\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" data-width=\"391\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Painful Price</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing that with the evacuations half completed, more lives would be at stake had Stane decided to order the other hits swiftly after the one in , Tony remotely controlled an empty armor to fight off Stane, while he was closing in to the facility himself. It was then that, in a stroke of genius, he proved what he meant in his earlier conversation with Reed Richards: He needed to be in four places at once. He needed to be an army. And by using the spare units in his armory, he did just that. Using the armors to contain damage, help in the evacuations, locate and prevent the suicide bombers from going off, and stopping Stane from giving the OK for the bombings to proceed, he handled every task at hand successfully. In the meanwhile, Stane, realizing he had been played, and gave the OK for the hits to start, while fighting off multiple older armors. It was at that point that Tony finally arrived at the scene, landing on top of Stane himself, and bracing for the final fight. Quickly immobilizing him, Tony asked him to cal off the hits, but Zeke refused. Holding yet another ace up his sleeve, Tony had planted devices in each location, to unleash electromagnetic pulses, and thus shutting down every piece of Stark equipment, from regular computers and advanced suits of armor, to even the suicide bombers. The fight continued without armors, neither for Tony, nor for Stane, with Iron Man finally putting Zeke down, mano-a-mano. With the entire crisis avoided, Iron Man could not help but think that Stane actually provided him with a fifth nightmare: what kind of a man he had to become, in order to stop his four nightmares from coming true, and the price with which those actions came to pass.</p><h3>The Mighty Avengers</h3><p>Iron Man as the Director of SHIELD is also given access to form a government sponsored Avengers team. He meets up with <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel</a> and tells her that she is to be the team leader. Together they become the poster boy and girl for the registration side and handpick the Avengers using the compiled database. Iron Man visits Thor in <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/4020-40990/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40990\">Asgard</a> to both ask him to register and became an Avenger again. Thor defeats Tony and causes his armor to malfunction. He states that he no longer complies to man’s laws and that if Iron Man ever came to Asgard again he would get an even worse welcome next time. Tony then asks him how is get back home where Thor tells him to walk.</p><p>In assembling the Avengers, Iron Man states that they need a “Thor” and a “Wolverine” to which Carol that she knows someone who is both a Thor and a Wolverine. They go together to recruit <a href=\"/ares/4005-11940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\">Ares</a>, God of War who is doing construction work. Iron Man threatens him to register with the government and join the Avengers and that if doesn’t comply he will get a beating along with his cover being blown amongst his coworkers. Ares states that Tony is bluffing and that he can’t defeat him. Tony wonders how Ares will fare against multiple opponents at Iron Man's level or above. Ares is somewhat amused by Tony’s attitude and states that if he will match his pay in the Avengers, then he will join. Iron Man and Ms. Marvel also select the Wasp, <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>, Black Widow, and the <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> (whom Iron Man states needs guidance although Carol is initially opposed to the idea). Together, they confront some very serious threats such as Ultron and Doctor Doom. The team is later disbanded in the aftermath of Secret Invasion, and Tony becomes a wanted man.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/secret-invasion/4045-47264/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-47264\">Secret Invasion</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516866\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516866\"><img alt=\"Tony the Skrull?!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony the Skrull?!\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony the Skrull?!</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark survives but is later confronted while in the hospital by <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a> who reveals a dead Skrull that had been impersonating <a href=\"../../elektra/29-1802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elektra</a>.

They go their separate ways, hoping to defeat the Skrulls on their own terms. Tony also wonders if Captain America during Civil War was a Skrull.</p><p>When an unidentified flying object lands in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Land</a>, Stark summons the Avengers to go and investigate.

Stark tells Cage to back off and that he is to be arrested. Luke Cage states that Stark’s repulsor beam can’t hurt him and that the real Stark would know that, implying that Iron Man is a Skrull. The two Avengers teams are about to go into a brawl, but Jarvis revealed to be a Skrull imposter deactivates Iron Man armor which electrocutes Tony inside. Meanwhile, the door to the spaceship opens and various heroes emerge sporting their classic incarnations.</p><p>The emerged heroes accuse the ones standing outside to all be Skrulls. This quickly turns into a battle but the characters get scattered once a dinosaur rampages through. Iron Man tells Ms. Marvel to head back to the city as he suspects that this was a successful trap to get the Avengers far away from the main action. Ms. Marvel states that she can bring him back as well but he states that it will be faster if she goes alone. Carol flies off and Iron Man heads towards his lab in the Savage Land to repair his armor. He is followed into his lab by Spider-woman, who reveals her herself to be the Skrull <a href=\"/queen-veranke/4005-54514/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54514\">Queen Veranke</a>. She states that Stark is a Skrull sleeper agent and he has done his job well preparing for the invasion. In efforts to break him, she kisses him telling him that he volunteered for this and that she promised to personally end his misery once his mission was completed. Just when she is about to kill him, Black Widow and Wolverine break in and save Stark whereas the Queen decides to retreat.</p><p>Black Widow injects the defeated Stark with a dose of adrenaline and questions him about where his allegiance lies. He states that sleeper agent or not, he doesn’t believe in the Skrulls ideology and will fight against them. Meanwhile, Mr. Fantastic is able to build a new Skrull detecting device as the previous ones proved to be outdated in use against them. He arrives on the Savage Land and scans the proximity of the area which reveals that all the heroes that emerged from the spaceship to be Skrulls. They are quickly defeated and the heroes return back to the city to confront the final climactic battle of the Invasion. Iron Man gathers some of his old equipment and rushes off to Central Park where the Skrull force has united for a final confrontation. He calls for the Avengers to assemble but they are also united with the rogue Avengers, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a>, Thor, Captain America and even villains such as the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts</a> and <a href=\"/the-hood/4005-41917/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41917\">the Hood</a>.

Public opinion of Osborn changes into that of a patriot and a war hero whereas Iron Man's becomes synonymous to failure.</p><p>Once, the Skrull Queen is murdered, the Skrulls begin to lose faith in the prophecy that states Earth to be their new home. They begin to retreat but many are thwarted by the Skrull <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a> who doesn't believe in their ideology and War Machine whom is sent by Iron Man. While destroying Skrull ships, War Machine finds many of the replaced heroes during the Skrull infiltration such as Elektra, Hank Pym, Spider-woman, <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a> and Dum Dum Dugan. War Machine is able to safely transport them back to Earth. Secret Invasion does not end without its casualties however and one of the most notable Avenger, the Wasp dies while attempting to use the size changing device that the Skrull Pym gave her. Iron Man attends her funeral and gives a speech honoring her memory and stating that far too many of their best have fallen in recent years including Steve. Hank Pym, however, cuts Tony’s speech short by interrupting and stating that he is very much responsible for their deaths. He also states why it is so that Tony hasn't died; Tony has no answer but feels his lost just the same. Finding this to be an opportune moment, Osborn also attending the funeral offers membership to Hank for his new Avengers. Hank curses him out in public and leaves.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/dark-reign/4045-55707/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55707\">Dark Reign</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632930\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1457142857143\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632930\"><img alt=\"Most Wanted\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Most Wanted\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 700w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Most Wanted</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded and replaced with the agency known as H.A.M.M.E.R. Both Tony and Maria Hill lose their positions in favor of Osborn. On Tony's last day, Osborn questions him about the Superhuman Registration database and how he could access it. Stark tells Norman that he would be breaking the law and thus would need to get proper authorization first. Frustrated, Norman tells him to leave his office.</p><p>Later, Stark has a conversation with Maria Hill and Pepper Potts discussing what Osborn is up to. He states that he deleted the Registration Database from the computers and that if Norman tries to access it all of his systems will get a virus. However, he tells that another instance of the database exists within his brain and that he has a plan to get rid of it but needs their help. Tony tells Pepper to put down Stark Industries and sends Maria Hill on an errand to retrieve a jump drive from FuturePharm, a pharmaceutical subsidiary and then deliver its contents to Captain America. In the meantime Tony works towards slowly deactivating his brain. Osborn calls for Tony to appear in public and answer accusations that he throws at him, and then for his lack of appearance issues an arrest warrant and order for H.A.M.M.E.R. to seize all of Stark’s assets.</p><p>Before leaving for her assignment, Maria Hill has sex with Tony. When she wakes up, she finds a note from Tony telling her to blow up her armory and notices that Stark has already gone off with one of his older suits. Meanwhile, Pepper is frustrated about the state of the company and in her anger destroys a mirror only to discover a secret passageway leading to a secret armor that Tony has designed for her. With the armor, Pepper escapes capture from H.A.M.M.E.R. and Tony, Pepper and Hill, all three become fugitives on the run from H.A.M.M.E.R. and Osborn.</p><p>During his run, Tony is continually forced to downgrade his armor as he loses the skills to monitor his more advanced armors. He also stages a fight with War Machine to make sure that Rhodey is not hunted, as well as runs into Namor who plans to deliver him to Osborn. Tony manages to escape and goes into Russia where the Crimson Dynamo (former enemy turned ally) buys him some time. Frustrated by Dynamo’s denial to allow H.A.M.M.E.R. into his country, he sends Madam Masque who has a history with Tony to find and kill him. Masque finds him with Pepper, whom she holds hostage with a gun on her head and asks Tony to tell her if he has ever loved her.</p><p>Tony stated that he used to but that he no longer does. However, since he has lost most of his memories he cannot recall enough of his past. While they are talking, Pepper manages to break free and tells Tony to run. They exchange a momentary kiss and Iron Man leaves Pepper as Rescue to deal with Madam Masque. Tony then finds refugee in Afghanistan and switches into his oldest armor.

The most serious issue is that he's in a persistent vegetative state. His body no longer knows how to breathe on its own. He is in a hospital, in Broxton, <a href=\"../../oklahoma/34-55803/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oklahoma</a>, on life support. Osborn wants to pull the plug and kill Stark, but he's unable to due to Tony having a living Will, which grants life or death decisions to his personal physician, <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Donald Blake</a>. Blake is at Tony's bedside along with Pepper Potts, Maria Hill, and <a href=\"../../bucky-barnes/29-40470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>. It is revealed that Stark 's body went into the vegetative state on its own, to prevent Osborn from getting any information from Stark, namely the identities of all Registered super-heroes, and the ever-exclusive Repulsor Technology. Stark pre-recorded a transmission into the <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rescue</a> armor, that details the steps needed on how to bring back, or \"Reboot\" Stark.</p><p>The first step involves taking the Repulsor battery out of Pepper, and into Tony. This is referred to as the \"Heart\" of the operation as the battery will fuel Tony's biology. The next step involves the data that Maria Hill recovered. The data was a hard drive that plugs into Stark's neck. Prior to upgrading to the Extremis armor, Tony backed himself on the hard drive. This serves as the \"Brain\" of the operation. The final step involves starting up the Repulsor generator. War Machine assists with the stripping of parts from the Rescue armor, specifically, the cables for channeling the Repulsor current. Tony is wheeled to the top of the hospital roof. The Shield of Captain America is placed near Stark , with the cables connected from the Shield to Tony's chest. Dr. Blake transforms into the Mighty Thor, and calls upon a lightning bolt on Cap's Shield. The Shield absorbs the lightning and the current flows from the Shield onto Tony. The operation is unsuccessful, and Stark is still in a coma. Afterwards, Captain America calls a consult, <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Stephen Strange</a> to offer his alternative methods.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside Tony's mind, we are given the image of a barren wasteland. Tony is trying to dig up something. He is joined by a couple , Howard and Maria. Every time Stark begins to dig, they are found by machines of his own design and they are blasted. Everything goes white, and the dream begins again and again, with Stark digging a little closer. Eventually, Stark and company are able to dig up an iron chestplate. Fearing the machines, they travel to a empty house. Tony puts on the chestplate, but nothing happens. Howard and Maria are found by the Starktech machines and are captured. Stark escapes capture by hiding in an underground bunker. He is then greeted by Dr. Strange, in astral form, who pledges to help bring Tony back , as \"the world needs its Iron Man\".</p><p>Considering Stark's current state a victory and no longer seeing him a threat, Norman Osborn orders <a href=\"../../the-hood/29-41917/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hood</a> and his gang to call off their hunt. <a href=\"../../madame-masque/29-13940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Masque</a> doesn't accept this and enlists the services of Thunderbolt <a href=\"../../ghost/29-17638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost</a>, to sneak in and pull the plug on Stark.</p><p>Dr. Strange continues to help Tony find himself inside his own mind, asking Tony to repeat the words, \"I am Iron Man\" over and over again. The two then journey to the bureaucrat to help Howard and Maria. Ghost then locates where Tony's body is being held, shooting Rhodey in the chest as he makes his way to Stark. Tony and Strange then run into one of the Stark sentries, Tony then ask if Strange was scared, which replies by saying that he wasn't actually there, and ask if Tony likes feeling afraid, which Tony tells him that he hates that feeling and fires off a Uni-Beam, destroying the sentry. Tony then looks at Strange, telling him \"I am Iron Man.\" Tony and Strange then make their way to a large complex, Strange then hears something like thunder and disappears. Tony then continues on, but runs into a group of people, who are walking in a pile of blood, that he knows, two of which were Happy Hogan and Yin Sen. Tony then makes it to the top, finding Howard and Maria inside, telling him to take a seat, that this is who they are, who he is, his legacy. Tony then tells them that he's not like them, not anymore, telling them that he chooses his own path, Tony is then consumed by a bright light.</p><p>Back in the real world, Strange and Maria try to hold off Ghost from killing Stark, but Ghost stabs Strange in the chest, and goes forward and begins to try to choke Stark to death. He is then stopped again by Maria, who he easily defeats, but Pepper Potts then claims that she is calling H.A.M.M.E.R. as they speak. Tony then wakes up, taking Ghost's \"Ghost Phone\" and tells him that he number to Stark Industries Seoul was 82-2-738-1059, saying \"It's funny the things you remember.\" Tony then uses the phone and sends Ghost to that number.</p><p>Captain America then arrives, asking Dr. Lisk how Stark was, Lisk then ask Cap if anyone knew how old that back-up Tony used to reboot himself was, saying that there's data missing. That when he talked to Stark, he told him that Cap was back, but didn't specifically say he had died, he then tells Captain America that there are simply things Tony Stark doesn't know. Pepper and Maria then find Tony on the computer, looking up things from the Civil War to Captain America's assassination, and about other recent things, shocked by what he is learning.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/siege/4045-55985/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55985\">Siege</a></b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724554\" data-ratio=\"0.70117647058824\" data-width=\"1275\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1275px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.1%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724554\"><img alt=\"Iron Man during Siege\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 1275w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man during Siege\" src=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 1275w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 960w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man during Siege</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark was recovering from his reboot in Broxton, Oklahoma under the care of Dr Donald Blake when Norman Osborn's strike force assaulted the floating city of Asgard.

Stark recently had to inject himself with the Extremis techno-organic virus to save his life. The effects are that now the inner layers of the Iron Man suit can be stored in the hollows of his bones, and he can control the suit with his mind through direct brain impulses. He can also remotely connect to just about any communication device, including satellites and computers, across the world. Stark can even regenerate organs due to the enhancement. Extremis also allows Stark to interface with his armor in a faster and more efficient manner as well, thus dramatically increasing his response time. Without his armor Tony Stark is considered to be above peak human and has displayed superhuman capabilities such as super human reflexes, His speed, strength and agility without his armor is now considered to be at peak human levels.</p><p>Iron Man's abilities are constantly changing because of his constant technological upgrades on the armors.</p><p>The armor is very durable, capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of punishment. Tony Stark's armor has a muscularly aligned matrix of crystallized iron enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other metals like titanium, which grants him endurance capable of withstanding high caliber bullets with ease. He can withstand rockets, torpedoes and such, although he does take damage.</p><p>The armor also enables Iron Man to fly at high speeds, exceeding the speed of a jet airplane, due to the rocket propelled boots that are placed on the bottom of the armor's boots.</p><p>Iron Man's suit has many power sources, such as solar converters, electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source. The suit is also able to convert nearby energy sources, such as heat or kinetic energy into electricity, or even drain electrical energy directly into the batteries for recharge. Although the suit has some open holes to allow the wearer to breathe normal air, it can be sealed off, allowing the pilot of the suit to go underwater or into space by granting its own life support and limited air supply systems.</p><p>As mentioned, Tony Stark controls the suit mostly by movement as if the armor is his skin and through the Extremis upgrade(before it started to fail), essentially making the suit an extension of his own body. In addition to this however is an internal artificial intelligence operating system that provides strategies, background information on opponents, and on surroundings and the current status of the suit.</p><p>The Extremis upgrade gave him a healing factor and enhanced abilities and could expel the inner-most armor layer in his body then \"will\" the rest of the Extremis armor to attach to him. While wearing the suit, Tony's strength levels are boosted to significant superhuman levels between 50 and 500 Tons of lifting capacity, based on the available power stores and design specifications of the suit in question.</p><p>Stark also has equipped the suit with numerous weapons over the years, making the suit more powerful each time. The most often used weapons are the repulsor rays (magnetically channeled beams of super-heated plasma) that are fired from Iron Man's palms or gauntlets. Other weapons that are built into the armor include the uni-beam projector in its chest (controlling the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum from blinding searchlights to cutting lasers), pulse bolts that pick up kinetic energy along the way, so that they hit harder the further they have to travel, an electromagnetic pulse generator and energy shield, the generation of ultra-freons, the creating and manipulating of magnetic fields, sonic blasts, and a holographic generator to create decoys.</p><p>Tony Stark has also created many specialized models of the armor. Other models that are in his possession include a model for deep-sea diving, for stealth, space travel, etc. He has also enhanced the armor on a few occasions for unique circumstances. For example, Tony Stark has modified suits like the \"Hulkbuster\" heavy armor, composed of add-ons to his so-called <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/iron-man-armor-mk-xi/4055-57420/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57420\">modular armor</a>, designed to enhance its strength and durability to allow it to take on the Incredible Hulk in combat. One time, when Stark had to face Thor, he made an armor modeled on the <a href=\"../../destroyer/29-7940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destroyer</a> and used a mystical power source.</p><p>While the Iron Man suit is very durable, high amounts of lighting or electricity can make the suit overload, as well as magnets, as this would happen to a regular machine.</p><p>Tony stark is effectively a genius, able to constantly create new and improved technologies and make upgrade after upgrade to his suit of cybernetic armor. Iron Man is able to harness his intelligence and ingenuity in order to allow him to defeat more powerful foes and escape their dangerous traps and machinations. Stark is also a powerful leader, able to command the loyalty and respect of others. Stark has been expertly trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand combat, making him a formidable opponent even without the power suit.</p><p>For more information on Iron Man's various armors see: <a href=\"../../iron-man-armor/18-50749/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man Armor.</a></p><h2>Iron Man/War Machine</h2><p>One of the most requested and sought after battles in the Marvel Universe has always been War Machine vs Iron man.

For that reason he decides to use his remaining time to the best of his ability, becoming a philanthropist and superhero using the armor he creates.</p><p>In the Ultimate Iron Man limited series, it's revealed that the reason for Tony's unprecedented brilliance is that his body contains a regenerative virus which caused him to grow extra neural tissue throughout his body, effectively expanding his brain. However, a side-effect causes him constant pain, which is mitigated by alcohol one reason why he drinks so heavily. On the upside, the virus also lets him regrow lost limbs and organs with incredible speed, as long as he has enough protein available. His skin is also impregnated with a \"bacterial armor\" that makes him resistant to impact, though it apparently isn't fireproof. The bacteria would eat the skin of anyone who can't regenerate in minutes, which is why he hasn't mass-produced the design.</p><p><b><a href=\"../../the-ultimates/49-18327/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Human</a></b></p><p>While forming the original <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimates</a>, Tony Stark along with <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a> are present for the thawing out of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>.

Iron Man is one of the main characters of the <a href=\"../../marvel-zombies/39-40611/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Zombies</a> storyline. Iron Man appears to be one of the uninfected heroes in the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier where the uninfected had met to hear Nick Fury's plan to save Earth from the virus. Iron Man is infected with the virus and he joins the infected zombies on the rampage to find food and consume it. He appears to be one of the zombies left in the Earth after everything was consumed and is one of the zombies to see <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Surfer</a> come to Earth to tell them that <a href=\"../../galactus/29-2149/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galactus</a> was coming to eat the planet. The zombies attack him and Iron Man loses his bottom half of his body during the fight but is thrown into the fray by <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>. After Silver Surer is subdued, Iron Man becomes one of the few to feast on the Silver Surfer and soon is able to fly again since he had gained a portion of the Surfer's powers. He is one of the zombies seen fighting Galactus, and he retreats to think of a plan to defeat Galactus. He thinks of making a machine where it combines all the zombies new Silver Surfer powers and unleash against Galactus. Iron Man, along with Hulk and Giant Man, build the machine while Galactus is fighting the others. They complete it and the zombies that had gained the Surfer's powers combine their powers into the machine and shoot a beam of the energy at Galactus. Galactus staggers a bit and they shoot a couple more until Galactus falls. Iron Man is one of the zombies that fight the villain zombies to see who would eat Galactus. The heroes easily win and they feed on Galactus, who was becoming conscious and Iron Man becomes one of the few who had gained Galactus's powers. He is seen appearing in an alien world flying with the zombies that had gained Galactus's powers. Later, Iron Man and the zombies are returning to Earth after forty years of consuming the universe. They return to Earth to see that there are still survivors and they attack the remaining survivors. They face opposition from Spider-Man and <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a> along with the survivors. Iron Man was the one who had breached the facility they were in and battles <a href=\"../../forge/29-4279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a>, <a href=\"../../tchanna/29-49798/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T'Channa</a> (controlled by <a href=\"../../trenton-craft/29-39511/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colonel America's</a> brain), and several acolytes. The zombies swarm in after the breach has occurred. Giant Man realizes his hunger had disappeared and and tells all the zombies that their hunger is gone. The zombies realize it too and they agree that they stop attacking and spare the survivors. However, an enraged Hulk appears and is hungry for food. Hulk assaults the survivors, but the zombie heroes intervene to save the survivors. Iron Man fights Hulk, but ultimately is killed by Hulk.</p><h3>Earth-20051</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/avengers-and-the-infinity-gauntlet/4050-35001/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-35001\">Avengers &amp; The Infinity Gauntlet</a>, <a href=\"/marvel-adventures-avengers/4050-18100/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18100\">Marvel Adventures Avengers</a>, <a href=\"/marvel-adventures-iron-man/4050-18737/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18737\">Marvel Adventures Iron Man</a></b></p><p>In the Marvel Adventures reality Iron Man is a member of the Avengers along with Captain America, Spider-Man, the Hulk, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a> and <a href=\"../../giant-girl/29-41570/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giant Girl</a>.

Here, voiced by Eric Loomis, Tony Stark is a founding member of the team and current leader. The show airs on Disney XD and had 20 micro-episodes released online prior to the shows premiere. This versions personality and origin closely resemble those of the Iron man films with Tony possessing a sharp irreverent wit and having his identity known to the public as well as his biggest goal (at the beginning of the series) being the destruction of stark weapons technology that has fallen into the wrong hands. He also possess absolute belief in science and it's ability to explain away magic. Like the comics he funds the avengers out of his own pocket and has a strong resentment against S.H.E.I.L.D (though he also has a love hate relationship with Maria Hill) He is strong friends with Hank Pym, enough so that he teases him about flirting with wasp though they clash with the ideology and goals of the Avengers. He also has a strong bond with Captain America even taking to heart one of Caps lessons about not forgetting the past while looking to the future. He respects Thor but often clashes with him over the existence of magic and his relationship with Black Panther is similar to that of the comics.

When the film opens, Tony is still seeking to find a way to protect the earth after the dissolution of the Avengers. When Bruce Banner returns to Earth (having previously ended up <a href=\"/sakaar/4020-41069/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41069\">Sakaar</a> after the events of <em>Age of Ultron) </em>with dire warnings about the coming threat of Thanos, Tony prepares himself for another fight.

Tony concocts a plan to lure Thanos into a trap by using Strange's <a href=\"/time-gem/4055-57126/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57126\">Time Stone </a>as bait, hoping they can steal the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/4055-40945/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40945\">Infinity Gauntlet </a>from the villain. The plot ultimately fails, as Strange is forced to surrender the Time Stone to Thanos in order to save Tony's life. When Thanos finally completes the Infinity Gauntlet, he wipes out half of all life in the universe, which kills most of Tony's allies on Titan (including Spider-Man).

After attempting to leave Titan in the Benatar, the deceased Guardians of the Galaxy's ship, Tony becomes stranded in space. He is eventually rescued by Captain Marvel, who takes him back to Earth. Back at Avengers HQ, Tony angrily blames Steve for causing the rift in the Avengers, which he claims helped lead to Thanos' victory.</p><p>Five years later, Tony and Pepper now have a daughter named Morgan Stark, who Tony loves very much. Despite being content in his retirement, Tony's guilt over the deaths of Peter and Thanos' other victims causes him to reunite with the Avengers as part of a plan to travel back in time and steal the Infinity Stones. During a stopover in the 70s to steal the Tesseract, Tony briefly encounters his father and has a conversation with him. Once back in the present, Tony suits up as Iron Man one last time during the battle with Thanos' forces. Following a lengthy fight, Tony sacrifices himself to defeat Thanos once and for all, using the Infinity Stones to destroy Thanos and his army. Mortally wounded, Tony dies with Pepper, Pepper and the resurrected Peter by his side. At the end of the film, the Avengers hold a funeral for Tony, honoring his memory and sacrifice.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><h4><b>Captain America And The Avengers</b></h4><p><b>For More Information:</b>

In the game's story mode, Iron Man arrives at Avengers Mansion, which has been overrun with aliens, and attempts to exterminate the creatures and destroy their computer terminal. After successfully doing so, he then has to defend the communications array that the heroes are using to coordinate their efforts against the invasion. Later, while searching a power plant for information on the invaders, Iron Man encounters <a href=\"/brigade/4005-50316/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50316\">Brigade</a>, one of the <a href=\"/the-imperfects/4060-50312/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50312\">Imperfects</a>, and manages to defeat him.

Unlike in the comics, though, Iron Man loses control of the nanites, and the nanite-controlled characters turn against him, and therefore the Pro and Anti Registration sides must unite in order to defeat them.</p><h4><b>Marvel Super Hero Squad</b></h4><p><b>For More Information:</b> <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/marvel-super-hero-squad/61-26649/\">Marvel Super Hero Squad</a></p><p>Iron Man appears as a playable character in the game adaptation of the show of the same name, Marvel Super Hero Squad.

To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, they provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight. Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment.

However this time it was revealed that the Red Skull had actually set up the meeting between Sam and Captain America on Exile Island. The Red Skull had actually changed Sam's persona and altered his memories. Sam Wilson, social worker of Harlem was actually Snap Wilson, notorious criminal charged with multiple cases of importation and sales of narcotics.
